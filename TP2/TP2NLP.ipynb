            "Stonemaier Games Presents VITICULTURE The Strategic game of Winemaking by Jamey Stegmaier & Alan Stone Old-world Tuscany awaits your winemaking skill and strategic cunning. You’ll plant vines, harvest grapes, age wines, and fill merchant orders to create the greatest winery in Italy! 2 – 6 players ages 13 & up • 45 – 90 minutes. Viticulture is a worker-placement strategy game that allows players to create their own Tuscan vineyard anywhere a table and a friend can be found. OBJECT OF THE GAME: Players begin the game with an old crush pad, three empty fields, a small cellar, two workers, and one grande worker. Players allocate workers and the occasional visitor to complete various tasks throughout the year. In the spring, players decide the schedule their workers will follow. An early rise gives the player the chance to act first; however, offering workers a later wake-up time gives you escalating bonuses. In the summer, players place workers on action spaces to plant vines and build structures that help advance that player’s vineyard. In the fall, players invite visitors to help their workers. In the winter, players place workers on action spaces to harvest grapes, create wine, and fill orders. COMPONENTS Cards: (118 total) * 42 vine cards (green deck) * 36 wine order cards (purple deck) * 20 summer visitor cards (yellow deck) * 20 winter visitor cards (blue deck),Boards: (double sided) * 1 game board * 6 vineyard mats, Pieces: * 30 worker meeples in 6 different colors and 1 gray temporary worker * 6 grande worker meeples * 50 grape and wine tokens (glass) * 6 wake-up tokens (roosters) * 6 victory point tokens (corks) * 6 residual payment tracker tokens (wine bottles) * 48 wooden structure tokens (8 unique tokens for each color) * 72 punch board lira (52 bronze 12 silver 1 coins, 2 coins, 8 gold 5 coins) * 1 first-player token (grapes GOAL: The goal is to reach 20 victory points, with victory points representing your reputation as a vineyard owner. When a player reaches 20 points, the current year will be played through the year end, and the player with the most points wins. Players may go beyond the 20-point goal, but they may not exceed 25 points. In the case of a tie, tiebreakers are (in order): Most lira Total value of wine in the cellar Total value of grapes on the crush pad. GAME BOARD SETUP: Each player places their rooster token above the wake-up chart and their cork token on the start space on the victory point track. Each player should also place their wine bottle token on the middle of the Residual Payment Tracker. Note 1: There are negative numbers on the victory point track for a few of the summer and winter visitor cards. A player may not go lower than -5 on the victory point track. If a player has -5 victory points, he may not use a visitor card that requires losing more points.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note 2: The game board and player mats are double sided. One side is fully labeled for beginners and the other side is unlabeled for experienced players. Other than the labels, there is no difference between the two sides. Note 3: All information on a player’s vineyard mat as well as available workers, amount of lira, and number of cards is public information and cannot be concealed. GAME PLAY OVERVIEW SETUP Remove pinot vine cards from the green deck equal to the number of players and give one to each player, then shuffle each deck of cards and place them on the board. Starting Resources per Player * A crush pad, a small cellar, and three fields (all on the vineyard mat) * 3 in coins * 1 pinot vine card  in hand * 1 random summer visitor card ( in hand * 2 workers * 1 grande worker. First round ♦ Take all of the rooster tokens that have been claimed by players, shake them up in your hand, and randomly pick one. The player with that color is the first player and gets the first player token ( Deck Maintenance: If any of the four decks are exhausted during play, immediately shuffle the discard pile and replace the deck. If the deck has been exhausted but no cards have been discarded, that deck is unavailable until more cards are discarded. Spring: Starting with the first player and moving clockwise around the table, players select the order in which they will “wake up” (turn order) by placing their rooster tokens on an unoccupied row on the wake-up track on the far left of the board. Each player immediately collects the corresponding reward. After all players have placed their roosters, the track displays the order in which players will take actions for the rest of the year. Fall: In the fall, according to the position on the wake-up chart, each player draws either a summer or winter visitor card and adds it to his hand. Any players who have built a cottage on their vineyard mats may draw one extra visitor card from either the summer or winter visitor deck Summer: In the summer, according to the positions on the wake-up chart, each player places one worker on a yellow summer action space on the game board and immediately takes that action (i.e., in a 2-player game, Player 1 places one worker, Player 2 places one worker, then Player 1 places another worker, and so on). The next player does the same until either all action spaces are taken, all players have passed, or all players are incapable of taking actions. If a player has passed, he may not place another worker until the beginning of the winter season. (All summer action spaces are described on pages 6 and 7. Winter: In the winter, players play in the same manner as in the summer, placing any remaining workers on the blue winter action spaces (each worker may only be used once per year).\n",
            "\n",
            "Just as in the summer, worker placement order in the winter is determined by the positions on the wake-up chart (the player at the top of the wake-up chart is still the first person to act in the winter, regardless of the last player to act in previous seasons). Year End: At the end of the year, players age grape and wine tokens, return workers to their vineyard mats, collect residuals, remove rooster tokens from the wake-up track, and rotate the first-player token counter clockwise. The game then ends if any player reached or exceeded 20 victory points Terminology: Throughout this manual, you will notice the terms value and price. Value refers to a grape’s worth when being turned into wine and the worth of a wine when filling an order. Price refers to the amount of money a grape will bring when sold. In Viticulture, grapes can be sold for immediate payments, while wine is “sold” via wine orders in exchange for victory points and residual payments. Spring actions: Wake-up chart: Starting with the player holding the first-player token and moving clockwise, each player places his/her rooster on an unoccupied wake-up level. The number represents how early that player wants his/her workers to wake up in the coming year. 1 is the earliest time and 7 is the latest. For workers, the later the better; for the vineyard owner, perhaps not Time 1: No bonus Time 2: Draw 1 vine card Time 3: Draw 1 wine order card Time 4: Gain 1 Time 5: Draw either a summer or winter visitor card Time 6: Gain 1 victory point Time 7: Gain the temporary worker for the year (acts as any regular worker) Helpful Tip: When a player passes during the summer, he will slide his rooster from the left to the right on the wake-up chart for a clear visual of the players that remain active. Then as players pass during the winter, they will slide their roosters back to the left. This will help players see who has yet to pass in the summer and winter. Example: Player 1, the player with the f irst-player token, chooses the 6 slot and gains a point on the victory point track. Player 2 chooses the 4 slot and gains 1 . So, even though Player 1 has the first-player token, for the rest of the year Player 2 will go first and Player 1 will go second based on where each player placed their rooster on the wake-up chart. Note: The first player to act in the summer, fall, and winter reverts back to the wake-up chart order from the spring of that year. Thus, in the example, above, even if Player 2 (level 4 on the wake-up chart) is the last player to act in the summer, he will be the first player to act in the fall, and then again in the winter Worker placement Example: * A player may use each worker only once a year. Thus a worker placed in the summer cannot be used in the winter. * A player may place multiple workers on the same action in subsequent turns if there are open action spaces. * Workers may only be placed on the current season’s action spaces. * If a player passes, he may place no more workers that season. * A player must take the action when placing a worker.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, if a player chooses the \"Sell Grapes\" action, that player must sell at least 1 grape. Vine deck Varieties and Values Each vine card has a circle with a number representing the value of grape the vine will yield. Some cards have structures in the upper-left corner (irrigation, trellis, or both). The depicted structures must be built before the vine can be planted GRANDE WORKER PLACEMENT: The grande worker follows the rules to the left for workers but also has a special ability. The grande worker may be placed on an already full action to perform that action. Multiple players may place their grande workers in this way. If you place your grande worker on a full action space, you do not gain the bonus on that action (see page 6). Example: You are playing a 2-player game and the other player chooses to give a tour with regular worker to gain 2 lira. If you really need to give a tour, you may then place your grande worker on that action (on the art for that action, not an action space) to gain 2 lira as well. Note 1: A field cannot exceed a total value of 6 when adding the value of the cards on the field together. For example: This vine produces a 2-value red grape, and a 4-value white grape when harvested for the maximum allowed value of 6. Note 2: Although there is some luck involved in which vine cards are drawn, a savvy player will maximize the vine cards he draws by pairing them with complementary wine orders Summer actions: Summertime in the game is the time to expand your vineyard, go to market, plant vines, put your summer visitor to work, show off your vineyard, and sell grapes. Important Notes about Summer and Winter Visitor Cards Note 1: When a player plays a summer or winter visitor card, the action described on the card is taken immediately and the card is discarded, ending any bonuses granted by that card. Example: If a player plays the “Buyer” summer visitor card, which says, “sell grapes at twice their value to gain 1 victory point,” that means that the player immediately sells their chosen grape(s), gains double the price of the grape(s), gains 1 victory point, and discards the card, ending the special bonus. The next time this player sells grapes, it will be at their normal price. Note 2: Visitor cards are played by placing a worker on the Play Summer/Winter Visitor Card action spaces. No additional worker is required to take the action described on the card. See page 12 for additional details on specific visitor cards. Gain +1 In the summer or winter, a player may place a worker on the cart at the bottom of the board to gain . Placing 1 worker here counts as a player's turn. Any number of workers may be placed on this action over the course of the year by any number of players. Yoke: The Yoke offers a special summer or winter action, provided a player has built this structure. In either season, a player may use the Yoke action to Uproot 1 Vine. The player\n",
            "\n",
            "takes 1 vine card from his field and returns it to his hand. This action is rarely used; its primary use is when a player needs to change the purpose of a field late in the game. Using the Yoke action space is the same as taking a board action. A worker must be placed there, and play then moves to the next player. Scaling The game based on number of players In the 2-player game, only the left action space is available; for the 3 – 4 player game the left and middle action spaces are available; and for the 5 – 6 player game all three action spaces are available. These action spaces may be claimed in any order. Each action space can be occupied by only one worker. Bonuses: Most actions have one action space with a special optional bonus. A player may take the bonus when placing a worker on an action space with the bonus icon in the middle. When placed on a full action space, a player may take the action and the bonus in any order, but they may only gain the bonus if they complete the action. For example, a player cannot place a worker on the “Fill 1 wine order” bonus space to gain 1 without also filling a wine order. Play One Summer Visitor Card: Play a summer visitor card from your hand to resolve its effect. Place resolved cards on the summer visitor discard pile at the top of the board. Draw One Vine Card: Draw one vine card. Bonus: Draw an additional vine card. Give A Vineyard Tour: Collect 2 . Bonus: Collect an additional 1 Build One Structure: Build one unbuilt structure on your vineyard mat by paying the cost and placing the corresponding structure token on your vineyard mat. (See page 8 for an explanation of each structure. Bonus: A 1 discount. Note 1: Players start the game with 3 f ields, crush pad, and small cellar. Note 2: Players may only have one of each structure on their vineyard mat. Plant One Vine: Plant a vine on one of the fields in your vineyard. Vines are planted by placing a vine card on an empty field, or stacking a vine card on top of another vine that has already been planted (max. value of 6 per field). Once a vine is planted, it stays on the field for the rest of the game, including when the field is harvested. The only way to remove a vine card is to use the Yoke or a visitor card to uproot it. Bonus: Plant an additional vine card from your hand. Sell Grapes: Sell any number of grape tokens (at least 1) from your crush pad for the price indicated by the coin between the crush pads. For example, a 4-value grape token is priced at 2 when sold. Discard the tokens you sell. Bonus: Gain 1 . Bonus: Play an additional summer visitor card\n",
            "\n",
            "Structures: Structures allow you to plant higher quality vines, make better wine, and gain special bonuses in the summer and fall. Each structure has a cost indicated by a coin on the player mat. Tasting Room ( 6): After a player builds a tasting room, he collects 1 victory point for every tour of his vineyard via action spaces or visitor cards (max 1 per year) Cellars ( +4 and +6): Players store wine in their cellar, but a small cellar affords only enough room for lesser value varieties. Building medium (4 – 6 value wine) and large(7 – 9 value wine) allows players to store higher value wines, as well as create and store blushes in the medium cellar and sparkling wines in the large cellar. Note: The medium cellar must be built before a player builds the large cellar. Cottage ( +4): A player who builds a cottage may draw a visitor card in the fall in addition to the visitor card drawn by default in the fall. The two cards drawn may be of the same type or different types of visitor cards. Note: When a player draws multiple visitor cards in the fall, he must draw all of the cards at the same time. Yoke ( +2): Owning a yoke gives a player an action space only he may use once per year in any season (summer or winter). Placing a worker on the Yoke can either let a player Uproot 1 Vine Card (remove a vine from your field return it to your hand) or Harvest 1 Field (see Harvest in the winter section). If a player uses the Yoke action space, a worker must be placed there as that player’s turn. Trellis ( +2): A trellis is required to plant certain types of vines. Irrigation ( +3): Irrigation is required to plant certain types of vines. Windmill ( +5): After a player builds a windmill, he collects 1 victory point whenever he plants a vine (max per year). Fall actions: Fall is a time to invite helpful visitors to your vineyard. These visitors will arrive in the summer or the winter to provide a helpful hand on your vineyard. In wake-up order, each player invites either a summer or winter visitor to his vineyard by drawing a visitor card of his choice. Players take this action without using workers. After a player builds a cottage, the player may choose to draw an extra visitor card every year, but must draw both of the cards at the same time. Winter actions: Winter is the time to reap what you have sown, turn grapes into wine, find out which wines are in demand, train new workers, put winter visitors to work, and fill wine orders Draw One Wine Order Card: Draw one wine order card. Bonus: Draw an additional wine order card. Harvest One Field: Choose one field and add grape tokens to the crush pad based on that f ield’s yield (see page 10 for details). Vine cards remain on the field when\n",

Gain +1: This action space is not limited to 1 worker. Spend 4 to Train a New Worker: Pay 4 to train a new worker. The additional worker is placed beside the “trainer” and is not active until the following year. Bonus: A +1 discount. Note 1: A player may have no more than 5 workers and 1 grande worker. This limit does not include the temporary worker Play One Winter Visitor Card: Play a winter visitor card from your hand to resolve its effect. Place resolved cards on the winter visitor discard pile at the top of the board. Bonus: Play an additional winter visitor card. Make Up to Two Wine Tokens: ♦ Turn grapes on the crush pad into wine (see page 10 and 11 for more details) Bonus: Make 1 extra wine token Fill One Wine Order: Fulfill the criteria on a wine order card and then discard it. See details on page 11. Bonus: Gain 1. Note: A player may use higher value wine to fill an order, but the difference is lost. Yoke: The winter action on the yoke—if the structure has been built and the action space is open—is to Harvest 1 Field Harvesting fields & making Wine Harvest When a player harvests a field, he picks grapes off the vines on that field. To harvest a field, add the total value of all red grape icons on the vine to create 1 red grape token and then add the total value of all white grape icons on the vine to create 1 white grape token on your crush pad. The vine cards remain on the field. Note 1: Each field can only be harvested once per year. Note 2: Each grape icon on the crush pad can fit exactly 1 grape token. If the grape icon already has a token on it when you harvest a grape at that value, you must devalue the grape token to the next lowest icon. Thus if the 4-value white grape icon on your crush pad already has a token on it when you harvest a field yielding a 4-value white grape, the new token would instead go on the 3-value white icon on the crush pad (if it’s empty). If there are no empty grape icons available for that grape’s value, you may not gain that grape token. Example: A player has three vines planted on one field. When she harvests this field, she adds the value of the two red-grape symbols (1 + 1) on the vines to form a single grape on her crush pad worth 2, and then the same for the two white-grape symbols (1 + 3) to form a white grape worth 4. Make Wine ♦ Make Up to 2 Wine Tokens: Players make wine by converting grapes on their crush pads into wine tokens. Low-value red and white wine tokens can be created when a player owns only a small cellar, but the cellar must be upgraded to create blush wine, sparkling wine, and higher-value red and white wine. When a player makes more than 1 wine token, the wine he makes may be the same type of wine or different types. Red Wine: Move 1 red grape token to the corresponding space on\n",
            "\n",
            "the cellar. For example, a 3-value red grape becomes a 3-value red wine. White Wine: Move 1 white grape token to the corresponding space on the cellar Blush: Combine 1 red grape token and 1 white grape token to make 1 blush wine token equal to the combined values of the grapes. For example, a 1-value white grape plus a 4-value red grape creates a 5-value blush wine. Sparkling: Combine 2 red grape tokens and 1 white grape token to make 1 sparkling wine token equal to the combined values of the grapes. Note 1: Discard excess tokens when creating blush or sparkling wine. Note 2: Players must build the appropriate cellar to house any wines, blushes, or sparkling wines above a value of 3 and 6. Note 3: Each wine icon on the cellar can fit exactly 1 wine token. This follows the same rules as explained in Note 2 in the Harvest section of page 10. Note 4: Once in the cellar, wine tokens may never be combined. Note 5: AA savvy player will make wine strategically based on the cellars he owns and the wine orders in his hand. After all, grapes in Viticulture age just like wine Example 1: A player decides to make 2 red wine tokens, but he doesn’t have the medium cellar yet. The 1-value red grape becomes a 1-value red wine, and the 4-value red grape is devalued to become a 3-value red wine Example 2: The player decides to make a blush wine token, so he combines a red and a white grape to form a single blush wine token equal to their cumulative value. He can only do this because he owns a medium cellar. Example: Filling a Wine Order This wine order card requires a red wine token worth at least 2 and a white wine worth at least 4. To fill this order, the player reveals the wine order card, removes exactly one red wine token worth at least 2 and exactly one white wine token worth at least 4 from his cellar, gains 3 points on the Victory Point Track, and moves up 1 on the residual payment tracker. The player then discards the wine order card Residual payments: Players keep track of residual payments from wine orders on the Residual Payment Tracker. All players begin the game with their wine bottle tokens on the lira symbol in the middle of the Residual Payment Tracker. When a player fills a wine order, that player moves his residual token up on the track based on the lira amount on the wine order card. It remains in that position—do not reset it. At the end of each year, each player gains lira equal to their position on the Residual Payment Tracker (1 = 1 ). The highest residual payment a player can receive 5 , even if they fill additional wine orders. (Players receive those payments at the end of each year. YEAR END At the end of each year, players age grape and wine tokens, remove all workers from the board, collect any residual payments earned from filling orders, and rotate the first-player token counter-clockwise to the next player.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the end of each year: Age Grape and Wine Tokens: Increase the value of all grape and wine tokens on your crush pad and in your cellar by 1 (i.e., a grape or wine token valued at 2 would move to 3 and a 3 would move to a 4). Wine and grape tokens may not have a value higher than 9. Note 1: Wine tokens can only be aged past the value of 3 if the medium cellar has been built and past 6 if the large cellar has been built Note 2: Players do not lose wine or grape tokens if they cannot age them. For example, if a player owns a medium and a large cellar and has red wine tokens valued at 8 and 9, when it comes time to age those tokens, they remain in the same position Return Workers: Return all workers to their respective players, and return the temporary worker to the Wake-Up Chart Collect Residual Payments for All Orders Filled: Players collect lira based on their position on the Residual Payment Tracker (max 5 per year) Discard Down to 7 Cards: At the end of each year, players must discard their hands down to 7 cards of their choice. Rotate First-player Token: Rotate the first player counter-clockwise and remove all rooster tokens from the wake-up chart Note: The new “first player” is merely the first player to select his worker placement order on the wake-up chart in the spring Visitor cards ♦ You may only play a visitor card if you are able to fully resolve the effect on the card. For example, if a card says that you must give all opponents +2 each to gain a benefit, you can only play that card if you have enough lira to pay +2  to all other players. Multiple actions on visitor cards may be taken in any order. Uncertified Visitors: All uncertified visitors let you spend victory points instead of money. As you can see on the game board, it is possible to have as low as -5 victory points. Thus you can spend victory points even if you are at or below 0 as long as they don’t take you below -5 Upgrading the Cellar: Several cards let you “upgrade your cellar to the next level.” That means you may build either a medium or large cellar, depending on what you already have (you may not build a large cellar if you don’t have a medium cellar). One Way Conversions ( ): Some cards allow you to trade lira for victory points (or vice versa) at a specific ratio. For example, +3 means that you can gain victory points at a rate of 1 for every 3 you spend. End game goal and Tiebreakers: When a player reaches 20 points, the current year will be played through the year end, and the player with the most points wins (max. of 25 points). See page 1 of the rulebook for tiebreakers. Friendly Variant ♦ A player may only choose a bonus action space if he completes that bonus (i.e., play a second summer visitor card) or if there is no other available space on that action. Thus players may not place workers on bonus action spaces to block other players as they can do in the standard rules\n"

            " Good morning, evening, afternoon everyone. My name is Mark and I'm Zof and we are the Board Adventurers. We're back to you today for another late to the game and we're coming at you with a oldie but a goodie. We're going to talk about Vinnaculture, the essential edition. Vinnaculture is a game that's published by Stone Mire Games and designed by Jamie Stegmeyer, Alan Stone and more in Peterson. I'm sorry if I mispronounced any of those games. So, Vinnaculture is a two to four player worker placement game where you're running your own vineyard and the essential edition introduces the year system which, okay, we've only played the essential edition so this is the only thing we can talk about. So, we're just going to go over the arc for this game. So, you start off in spring where you pick your turnover and it's based on this small track wherever you place it on that your meatball on that track, your little rooster tokens, like how you want to wake up every day. That'll take the turnover for the rest of that year, which is like around. And going down the list, if you want to go further down, like you want further behind in the year, you get a certain benefit based on where it is. So, if you want to go first, you immediately will go first but you get nothing out of it. Yeah. Then you go into summer. So, summer lets you do things like building structures, it lets you plant vines which are the green cards that are in this game. It lets you take a summer visitor so you'll have people coming to your vineyard and like, hey, let's take you on a tour. And then you can also gain money and you can buy or sell one of your field cards which are like these. So, you'll have three of these on your own personal board. If you ever decide to sell it, you'll get it for the money that's based on there and then you'll shift it to sold. Meaning that you can't play anymore vine, the green cards on these cards. So, once summer is over, you're going to go into fall. Fall is each person will get a visitor card. Now, if you decide to play the cottage structure, if you built that during the summer, you get to draw another visitor card either from summer or winter. In there, winter gets a little more complex because there's a certain order to a lot of things. You can play visitor cards. You can make wine so you can harvest your field. Meaning that whatever of these vines you have on your field, you can take that color and you can put that onto your board. Once it's on your board, you can then turn that into a certain wine with another action on the board. That'll be further down the road. At the end of each year, whatever wine you have in your cellar or you have in your general overall, it's going to age. So, it'll go up once. Meaning it'll increase almost in, I'm not really intensity, but in number. So, it'll make a better type of wine. That's generally it. Once it's a point system, so once you get to 20 points, the game is going to finish out for the year and whoever has the most points at the end of that year wins the game. That's basically how you play video culture. What do you think about it? So, video culture is a game that I really enjoy. It does, it's just three aspects of this game that really is on my alley that I really enjoy by it. The first being how thematically sound this whole placement game is, you really feel like you're building up your own vineyard. And creating the business and selling off the wine. It just kind of works as a thematic thing. You are each spot that you go to as a work of placement game is more than just collecting a resource that's a different color. Which a lot of work of placement games do. So, like each spot is unique for the theme that it is. And it makes sense for the arc of the game that you're going as a go from like the beginning of the year to the end of the year. So, it just kind of makes sense for me. That's the first thing too. I just like the theme of this vineyard. And through I love the Grande worker. Oh yeah, I didn't talk about the Grande worker yet. Yeah. The Grande worker is probably my favorite. One of my favorite additions to worker placement game. It's kind of like you're not locked out of the space. You're not getting the full benefit either. I like that. Because it's a game that has sort of like a flow to it. You need certain things. So, it's not like other worker placement games like Lords of Waterdeep as an example. In which if you get locked out of a certain location, you can kind of switch its strategy a little bit. And still be in it. This game you kind of need to go certain spaces to kind of keep pace. Yeah. Almost. Yeah. Because it's how different each spot is. So, I like that they added the Grande worker to kind of fix that aspect of the game. Because from what my understanding is the Grande worker wasn't part of the original game. Yeah, that's what my understanding was too. The essential addition took in, I believe, the Tuscanie expansion. And it added in everything into just one game. Yeah. So, I really like the addition of the Grande worker. It kind of really makes this game kind of sing for me. Yeah, and like back to like kind of like to reiterate what you said. When it comes to say like a water deep type of game. If you've been locked out of a space, you can't you visit the wait until the next round for you to go back. When it comes to Grande, it's like, okay, I can use my Grande in a summer or the winter. Yeah. If I how badly do I need that space, right? Because if I need this to do what I need to do in the winter, but I'm still second or second to last in the winter. Yeah. I don't know if I want to take that risk now, take it later. It's a very planning time. Yeah. You need to plan out. Right. What you how you have to be in between winter and the previous round. Right. Because like once like once you've used your workers in summer, they don't come with you to winter. Yeah. So like if you could actually spend all your workers in summer, if you if you needed to, then have nothing to do for that winter. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like that's that's like kind of like one of the cool things about it too. He's like, oh, I see. So like I I have to really prioritize what, you know, what's important for me to get this wine made. Yeah. I thought it was very interesting when I first played this game that the board is kind of segmented based off of summer or winter. I thought that was something that was really going to bother me. Right. But I it really works. I think it's because of how thematically sound the game is. In terms of how it utilizes it's it's locations for what you're doing. I think it feels linear, right? Because you start to spring on the floor left. They're like, okay, I know when I'm going to wake up and it has like almost like a like a wave towards the right side, right? Like I know now I need to focus in this section for summer. Then I go further over and then now this is my winter section. And like going back until I say, like player count, like I like the way that they add in extra spaces for the player count. Like it tells you, hey, if you have four players, you can go up to two of these spaces, right? It scales with player count for all of this. Agreed. Yeah. And one aspect of this game that I really enjoy and this is going again on a thematically sound aspect is that the build and other resources that you build like the wind, the windmill. Yeah. Like little little aspects of the game that you build out that makes the play not easier for you, but in advance is what you can do in the game. Right. And it just makes it feels like a build and now a venue. You're adding aspects to it that's going to make the game what you're doing easier for you. Yeah. I didn't like it. So like in most cases, you actually have to take the build structure action, right? Because in order for you to have a bearer, almost wines, like you need to have the the blush wine or like the champagne wine. You need to actually have the medium and the large seller and you can't just go straight to building a large seller. You have to build medium first and then you have to build them to large. Yeah, man. Those take a lot of money. Yeah. Like you build it takes a lot of money, but it also feels like you build enough of business. Yeah, exactly. It's like you don't, yeah, you don't go crazy at first. You don't build a huge one. You're like, oh, I don't know what the story is. Then there's like, oh, yeah, I need the medium and now I want to actually now can eat into medium wines. Yeah. And then now you can now build out into your large home. What do you think about how turn order works in this game? Because it changes from year to year. I love games that have variable turn order. I don't, sometimes like you can almost like in games where like say you're about to end around and you have a certain amount of money, but you know you're first and you're going to see like some, you know, someone is like ending their turn and I'm like, okay, I'm not going to do my action because I know I'm first next turn. This game kind of like flips it a little bit in that, oh, it's, you can you can shift around. So we might skip me to the next person, but then I'll come back to me for the second turn. Yeah. I like that because it also gives me an incentive like say I need another visitor. I can go further down the list, get that visitor card if it doesn't, it doesn't really affect what I need to do for that year because I know if I go second and go to player game, I have the ability to go to most if not all the spaces still. Yeah, I'm a big fan of variable turnovers such as yourself. I think it just adds a great tension to the game. Yeah. It signifies something to the whole group and it makes everyone think about what's happening for that round that's coming up. So specifically for a video culture, if a player goes to first, they go to number one, they want to go first. It makes everyone think why did they do that? Because any other order gives you any other number that you go to gives you a resource. Yeah, something. Yes, gives you something that you need. If you go to one, you're not gaining anything, but the person being still guaranteed that you're going to go first. Right. Why would you do that? Yeah. And then it adds that interest and tension to that round. Yeah. I love that kind of stuff. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I'll be very good turnovers. Yes. So one of the other cool things about the culture is the idea of the crush pad. So once you make wine and you play onto your crush pad from your vine, you can actually turn those into wine in your cellar by combining different colors of crush pad. Yeah. So you have the red and then you have the white. You can actually then combine them to make a blush wine or to make a champagne wine or sparkling wine. But that's really kind of like the cool thing because it's also gets aged as well. Anything that remains on your crush pad gets moved on. Yeah. And then you fill out these orders off of that once you make your wine. So you'll have like the red, the little order on the top left of the card. Then you get the victory points, which is like one of the main ways you can win in this game is getting these victory points. Yeah. But it also comes with the residual. So there's a little piece on the board that gives you almost a residual amount of money to start with at the start of each year. And sometimes that feels good because sometimes you're really in money deprived. So currently in this game to get money is to be like, okay, I can do stuff now. I can you know, develop my buildings a little better. I can spend it on you know, paying for this you know, visitor or this worker on my board. And it's to be great, you know, kind of like cycle that it would go through. Yeah. No, 100 percent. So in terms of buy, play or skip altogether, what are you reading? Did it culture? Hmm. That's a question. Um, huh, man. I had to think about what my favorite worker placement games are. And I feel like during the pandemic, there wasn't a game that I played more than this one in terms of worker placement. Yeah. I think often that I would have to say this is definitely a buy as an essential, for the essential addition, this is definitely a buy. Yeah. It just feels like I'm almost immersed in the vineyard theme. And I, I understand if you don't like that idea, then this might not be your type of game. Yeah. Um, but I just love going through each of these almost years, these rounds. And it just feels like I'm kind of like playing out a vineyard. You know, yeah. It's, it's, to me, it's like almost relaxing when I play this game. I don't feel like I'm really competing too much when I play this game. Yeah. Other than what you're self-conscious. Yeah. Sort of. And like I've heard cases where like, you know, if it's actually possible not to make wine in this game and still win. Oh, and I've seen that and it actually has happened when I played, but it's still a fun game. I think it's, I think that's still a great aspect to find a way to do it without having to build out your seller, build out your wine. If that's a possibility for you, we didn't even talk about the models of poppies yet because those give you starting abilities. Yeah. Um, but there, there's just a lot of variety I feel in this game that I think if you like work for placement, this is definitely one that you should definitely check out at the very least. I agree with you there. This is also a buy for me as well. Um, one thing that you said about this game is you mentioned that this is very relaxing for you. Mm hmm. And I think this is kind of, it has a really, really good flow. In terms of summer to winter, just kind of feeling of building up a vineyard. Right. Because you don't really start selling your wine until later in the game is not like something you do in the first couple turns. Yeah. Um, it just, it really does have a really, really nice flow. And if you like work for placement games, I think this does a lot of things within that, that genre of board games very well. Really? Especially in terms of matching it to the theme of the game as well. It just all flows and fits together very well. All the spots and all the workers spots that you can go into are really thought out and really fits to what they're trying to do and make you feel while you're playing the game. I do know that this is not a game for everyone. We played this with people who we've been this and, yeah, so we might be outliers in terms of all. Yeah, it feels like we are, yeah. But it does really works for me. And it's not in a game that I pull out, we want to pull out all the time, but it's definitely a game that I still were very even in the game. Yeah, I think we've only played it once this year. Yeah. For far, but I remember that one play just being like, I remember like the skate just so great. Yeah, I really enjoyed this game a lot. Yeah, it just works. Everything that it's trying to do, it, it does very well. Yeah. I can't even think of any cons for this game. And I usually try to bring up cons with our big relate to the game or for our first off, the salt that we do. I couldn't really think of one for this one. Yeah. So yeah, I like speaks to how much we love this game. Yeah, it's great. I definitely would say go try it and lean towards like, definitely get it if you like it. Sure. Yeah, 100%. Cool. Well, I'm Zo. I'm Mark. See you on the next adventure.\n"

            "Introducción La Toscana espera tu habilidad para elaborar vino y tu astucia estratégica. Plantarás vides, cosecharás la uva, envejecerás los vinos y cumplirás los pedidos de los comerciantes para crear la mejor bodega de Italia. Y así se nos presenta Viticulture , un juego diseñado por diseñado por Jamey Stegmaier y Alan Stone, los también responsables de Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia. El juego fue financiado mediante una campaña de micromecenazgo a través de KickStarter en 2013. Para tal efecto se fundó la editorial Stonemaier Games fusión de parte de los apellidos de los dos autores. El pasado 2014 tuvo una segunda edición con motivo del lanzamiento de Tuscany, la expansión de Viticulture. De las ilustraciones se encargaron Jacqui Davis, Beth Sobel y David Montgomery. Los dos primeros ilustradores también dieron vida a Euphoria, mientras que el sr. Montgomery no tiene otros proyectos en el mundo lúdico a parte del título que nos ocupa. El juego no ha sido editado en nuestro país y tiene cierta dependencia del idioma, ya que las cartas y los textos de los tableros están en inglés aunque son textos bastante asequibles. El manual puede descargarse en castellano en la propia web de la editorial. Permite partidas de 2 a 6 jugadores , con una edad mínima sugerida de 13 años y una duración aproximada de unos 90 minutos . El precio de compra recomendado es de 49,95  . Para esta reseña se ha utilizado la segunda edición de Stonemaier Games. Importante : si ya conoces el juego yo sólo te interesa mi opinión sobre el mismo, puedes pasar directamente al apartado de Opinión . Los apartados Contenido y Mecánica están destinados especialmente a aquellos que no conocen el juego y prefieren hacerse una idea general de cómo funciona. Ir a la Opinión Personal Contenido Dentro de una caja de cartón de dos piezas tapa y fondo, de dimensiones 26,721,610,2 cm. tamaño peculiar, más pequeño que una caja rectangular de Eurogame, aunque con más fondo en la caja, nos encontramos con los siguientes elementos: Tablero Principal reversible de cartón 118 Cartas 6845 mm. 42 cartas de vid mazo verde 36 cartas de pedido mazo púrpura 20 cartas de visitante de verano mazo amarillo 20 cartas de visitante de invierno mazo azul Liras de cartón 52 monedas de 1 Lira 13 monedas de 2 Liras 8 monedas de 5 Liras 6 Tableros Individuales Reversibles de cartón 36 trabajadores 6 de cada color: verde, morado, naranja, azul, amarillo y blanco de madera 6 trabajadores grandes 1 de cada color de madera Trabajador temporal Gris de madera 60 fichas de uva y vino de cristal 6 fichas de despertador gallos de madera 6 fichas de puntos de victoria corchos de madera 6 fichas de pago residual botellas de vino de madera 48 fichas de estructura de madera 8 fichas distintas para cada color de madera 42 cartas de vid mazo verde 36 cartas de pedido mazo púrpura 20 cartas de visitante de verano mazo amarillo 20 cartas de visitante de invierno mazo azul 52 monedas de 1 Lira 13 monedas de 2 Liras 8 monedas de 5 Liras Mecánica Viticulture es un juego de colocación de trabajadores en el que llevaremos el control de una finca en la que gestionaremos todo el proceso de producción del vino. La principal diferencia con otros juegos del mismo estilo es el uso de una serie de cartas que servirán para potenciar acciones o definir nuestras estrategias a largo plazo. Conceptos Básicos Empecemos con el Tablero Principal . Tres grandes zonas: En la parte superior tenemos los espacios habilitados para los 4 mazos vides, visitantes de verano, pedidos y visitantes de invierno y sus descartes. En la zona central, ocupando prácticamente todo el tablero, tenemos las distintas acciones que los jugadores podrán realizar, divididos en acciones de verano de color amarillo y acciones de invierno de color azul. Existe una acción especial que puede ser usada tanto en verano como en invierno y no tiene límite de capacidad de trabajadores situada en la zona inferior central del tablero. Además, a la izquierda tenemos la tabla de despertador, que marcará el orden de turno para todo el año una vez que se rellene. A la derecha tenemos un pequeño resumen de cómo se desarrolla un año y, justo debajo, un rondel para los pagos residuales. En la zona inferior tenemos el marcador de puntuación. Por otro lado tenemos los Tableros Individuales de cada jugador, divididos también en tres partes bien diferenciadas: En la zona superior tenemos los tres campos en los que podremos plantar los distintos tipos de vides. En la zona inferior izquierda tenemos los lagares donde iremos almacenando la uva recogida en la vendimia. En la zona inferior derecha tenemos las bodegas donde iremos almacenando el vino una vez embotellado. Adicionalmente, en distintas ubicaciones del tablero hay unos pequeños dibujos identificando las distintas Estructuras que podremos ir construyendo en nuestros dominios. Las podemos dividir según su funcionalidad: Irrigación y Emparrado : permiten plantar determinadas cartas de Vid. Bodega Mediana y Bodega Grande : permiten almacenar vinos de mayor valor. Yugo : permite ejecutar una acción en el tablero individual. Sala de Cata , Molino y Caseta : potencian ciertos aspectos del juego general. El juego tiene dos grandes mecánicas. La primera es la colocación de trabajadores , que en este juego es algo peculiar: las acciones podrán ser activadas por varios jugadores en una misma ronda, pero no por todos. Depende del número de jugadores. Así pues, para 2 jugadores solo está habilitado el primer espacio, para 3-4 jugadores se habilita el segundo espacio con bonificación, y para 5-6 jugadores se habilitan los tres espacios. Además, el primero que la ejecute disfrutará de una bonificación. Es importante indicar que un espacio de acción solo podrá ocuparse si puede ejecutarse completamente, incluida la bonificación. En caso contrario, un jugador no podría ocupar dicha posición, salvo que este sea el único espacio disponible, en cuyo caso si se podrá ocupar sin recibir la bonificación. Adicionalmente, en esta segunda edición se ha añadido un trabajador grande, que tiene la ventaja de poder activar cualquier acción, incluso si todos los espacios están ocupados. La otra gran mecánica es la gestión de la mano de cartas , por lo que hay que hablar de los distintos tipos de cartas que podrán robarse: Cartas de Vid : son las distintas variedades de uva que podremos plantar en nuestros campos. Estas cartas poseen en banda superior el nombre de la variedad, así como un posible requisito en infraestructuras emparrado yo irrigación, aunque algunas variedades no necesitan ninguna. En la zona inferior tendremos los tipos de uva y el valor de ésta al vendimiar. Cartas de Pedido : son pedidos que los jugadores podrán satisfacer con vinos de sus bodegas. En la esquina superior derecha aparecen los vinos requeridos valor y tipo. En la zona inferior tendremos los Puntos de Victoria obtenidos al satisfacer el pedido y el avance en el rondel de pagos residuales. Cartas de Visitantes de verano : representan a distintos profesionales que pueden ofrecernos sus servicios. Estas cartas solo podrán jugarse en verano y, normalmente, ofrecen acciones potenciadas o una segunda vía para obtener puntos de victoria. Cartas de Visitantes de invierno : funcionan de forma idéntica a las de Visitantes de verano, con la única diferencia de que solo podrán jugarse durante el invierno. En el juego existen dos Tipos de Uva , tinta y blanca , las cuales se almacenarán en los Lagares una vez que finalice la vendimia. Estos lagares muestran nueve posibles valores del 1 al 9 para cada una de los dos tipos. Estos valores se encuentran separados en tres filas para cada tipo, de forma que se les asocia un precio en función de la fila en la que se encuentre el valor de una determinada uva. Es decir, que uvas de distintos valores pueden tener el mismo precio. Es importante indicar que los valores totales indicados en las cartas de vid son unos valores máximos, ya que el valor de la uva al ser recogida dependerá de la capacidad de almacenamiento de nuestros lagares. Si el valor de una uva ya se encuentra ocupado, tendremos que almacenarla en un espacio anterior, reduciendo su valor. Si no existiesen espacios entre el valor máximo de la uva hacia atrás, la uva se perdería. El Vino se produce a partir de la uva recogida. El valor de dicho vino estará directamente relacionado con el valor de la uva utilizada. Tenemos cuatro tipos de vinos, los cuales requieren diferentes combinaciones de uvas: Tinto : necesita de una unidad de uva tinta. El valor máximo del vino producido corresponderá con el valor de la uva tinta utilizada. Este valor oscila entre 1 y 9. Blanco : necesita de una unidad de uva blanca. El valor máximo del vino producido corresponderá con el valor de la uva blanca utilizada. Este valor oscila entre 1 y 9. Rosado : necesita de una unidad de uva tinta y de una unidad de uva blanca. El valor máximo del vino producido corresponderá con la suma de los valores de las uvas utilizadas. Este valor oscila entre 4 y 9. Espumoso : necesita de dos unidades de uva tinta y de una unidad de uva blanca. El valor máximo del vino producido corresponderá con la suma de los valores de las uvas utilizadas. Este valor oscila entre 6 y 9. Al igual que ocurría con la vendimia, el valor con el que es producido un vino, además de los valores de las uvas utilizadas, dependerá de la capacidad de almacenamiento de nuestras bodegas. Al producir un vino, si el valor máximo de este ya se encuentra ocupado por otro vino, tendremos que ubicarlo en un valor inferior. Si no dispusiésemos de espacios, el vino se perdería. Al principio comenzamos con una bodega pequeña, en la que solo podremos almacenar vinos de hasta valor 3. Con la bodega mediana podremos almacenar vinos de hasta valor 6. Y con la bodega grande podremos almacenar vinos de hasta valor 9. Para construir la bodega grande es necesario haber edificado la bodega mediana previamente. Tanto las uvas como los vinos irán envejeciendo con el paso de los años, aumentando su valor en el proceso. Como veremos en la mecánica, al final de cada año, uvas y vinos aumentarán en una unidad su valor, siempre y cuando la capacidad de almacenamiento de bodegas y lagares lo permita. Si no, mantendrán su valor. Como hemos dicho, en nuestros campos podremos ir colocando las cartas de Vid. Solo existe una limitación a la hora de mezclar las distintas variedades en un mismo campo: que el valor total de todas las uvas de las cartas colocadas en dicho campo no sobrepase un total de 6. Por lo demás, podemos intentar cualquier combinación. Existen nueve variedades distintas, con diversos valores para los tipos de uvas y requisitos para poder plantar. Acabo de hablar de los Pagos Residuales . Como hemos visto antes, estos se representan mediante un pequeño rondel en la zona inferior derecha. Cada vez que satisfagamos un pedido, nuestro marcador avanzará en sentido horario una serie de posiciones. Al final del año recibiremos las liras indicadas en la posición que indique nuestro marcador. Además de las uvas y los vinos, el otro gran recurso que gestionaremos a lo largo de la partida es el dinero . Este será utilizado, principalmente, para la construcción de estructuras que potencien nuestro sistema de producción. Las vías para obtener dinero son: venta de vinos mediante el pago residual, cartas de visitantes de invierno y de verano y ciertas acciones en el tablero principal. El último concepto es el del Despertar para trabajar. Como veremos en la mecánica, en la primera estación de cada año, la primavera, los jugadores decidirán la posición en el orden de turno, de forma que cuanto más temprano se despierten se aseguraran disponer más acciones libres, mientras que cuanto más tarde comiencen a faenar, mayores beneficios podrán obtener a costa de arriesgarse no tener disponibles algunas acciones. Y con esto ya tenemos suficiente. Preparación de la Partida Se despliega el tablero en el centro de la mesa. Cada jugador recibe un tablero individual y todos los elementos del color elegido. Se disponen las monedas en una reserva común, entregando 3 Liras a cada jugador. También se dejan cerca del tablero los marcadores para las uvas y los vinos. Se separan las cartas de Pinot del mazo de Vid y se entrega una de estas cartas a cada jugador. Las sobrantes se reintroducen en el mazo. Se barajan los 4 mazos de cartas por separados y se colocan en el espacio correspondiente en el tablero principal. Se colocan las fichas de corcho de los jugadores en la posición 0 del marcador de puntos de victoria Se colocan las fichas de botellas en la Lira del marcador de Valor Residual. Se colocan las fichas de Gallo cerca de la tabla de Despertador. Cada jugador coloca sobre su tablero el trabajador grande y dos trabajadores pequeños, dejando el resto junto a todas las fichas de estructuras de su color. Se coloca el meeple del trabajador temporal en el último espacio de la tabla de Despertador. El jugador más joven será el jugador inicial, recibiendo la ficha de uvas. Y ya podemos comenzar! Desarrollo de la Partida Una partida de Viticulture se desarrolla a lo largo de un número indeterminado de rondas, finalizando la partida en aquella en la que se cumple la condición de finalización. Cada ronda, a su vez, se divide en cinco fases: las cuatro estaciones primavera, verano, otoño e invierno y el final del año. Fase I: Primavera Empezando por el jugador inicial y siguiendo en sentido de las agujas del reloj, cada jugador coloca su gallo en una de las posiciones de la tabla de despertador, obteniendo las recompensas correspondientes. Para el resto del año se utilizará el orden establecido en esta tabla. Fase II: Verano Siguiendo el orden de la tabla de despertador, cada jugador podrá: Ejecutar una acción de verano, colocando su trabajador en uno de los espacios habilitados en las distintas acciones de verano dependiente del número de jugadores. Es obligatorio poder ejecutar completamente la acción, incluida la bonificación, si la hubiese, salvo que el espacio con bonificación sea el único disponible. En este caso podría utilizarse sin recibir la bonificación. Pasar, no pudiendo volver a ejecutar acciones en esta estación para el año en curso. Las acciones disponibles en verano son: Tomar carta de Vid : el jugador roba una carta del mazo correspondiente y la coloca en su mano. Bonificación: tomar una segunda carta de Vid. Organizar una Visita : permite obtener unos ingresos extras de 2 Liras por visitar nuestras instalaciones. Si se ha construido la Sala de Catas, además, se obtiene un Punto de Victoria solo 1 por año. Bonificación: se obtiene una Lira adicional. Construir una Estructura : se paga a la banca la cantidad de Liras correspondientes a la estructura que se desea construir y se coloca en el lugar adecuado tapando el coste. Bonificación: se aplica un descuento de 1 Lira. Plantar carta de Vid : permite colocar una carta de Vides uno de nuestros tres campos, siempre que no incumplamos que el valor conjunto de las variedades supere un total de 6. Adicionalmente, si tenemos construido el Molino, anotamos un punto de victoria solo 1 por año. Bonificación: plantar una segunda carta de Vid puede ser en otro campo. Vender Uvas : permite vender cualquier número de unidades de uva por el precio indicado en la fila correspondiente a su valor 1, 2 o 3 Liras. Bonificación: se obtiene un punto de victoria. Jugar carta de Visitante de verano : se juega una carta de visitante de verano, aplicando su efecto para, posteriormente, descartarla. Bonificación: jugar una segunda carta de Visitante de verano. Existen dos acciones especiales que pueden ser ejecutadas tanto en verano como en invierno Ayudar en el tablero principal: se obtiene 1 Lira. Esta acción no tiene límite de trabajadores. Arrancar Vid en el tablero individual: si se ha construido el yugo y el espacio no está ocupado por un trabajador, se puede colocar un trabajador en esta acción para recoger una carta de Vid de uno de nuestros campos y llevarla a la mano. Fase III: Otoño Siguiendo el orden de la tabla de despertador, cada jugador podrá robar una carta de Visitante de verano o de invierno. Los jugadores que hayan construido la Caseta podrán tomar una segunda carta de Visitante, ya sea de verano o de invierno, independientemente de la primera carta elegida. Fase IV: Invierno Siguiendo el orden de la tabla de despertador, cada jugador podrá: Ejecutar una acción de verano, colocando su trabajador en uno de los espacios habilitados en las distintas acciones de invierno. Es obligatorio poder ejecutar completamente la acción, incluida la bonificación, si la hubiese, salvo que el espacio con bonificación sea el único disponible. En este caso podría utilizarse sin recibir la bonificación. Pasar, no pudiendo volver a ejecutar acciones en esta estación para el año en curso. Las acciones disponibles son: Cosechar : se elige un campo que aún no haya sido cosechado este año y se coloca una ficha de uva en los lagares por cada tipo de uva presente en dicho campo. El valor de la uva será la suma de los valores para cada uno de los dos tipos. Si el espacio para el valor de una uva está ocupado, se coloca en el valor inferior más próximo disponible. Colocaremos un marcador sobre el campo para indicar que ya ha sido cosechado este año. Bonificación: cosechar un segundo campo. Pisar Uva : convierte uvas en vino. La acción permite producir dos vinos, independientemente de la cantidad y tipos de uva que necesite. Los vinos generados corresponderán a la suma de los valores de las uvas utilizadas. Si no hubiese espacio en las bodegas, se coloca en el valor inferior más próximo disponible. Bonificación: produce un tercer vino. Tomar carta de Pedido : se toma una carta de Pedido del mazo. Bonificación: tomar una segunda carta de Pedido. Jugar carta de Visitante de invierno : permite jugar una carta de Visitante de invierno, descartándola posteriormente. Bonificación: jugar una segunda carta de Visitante de invierno. Satisfacer Pedido : permite completar un pedido, descartando los marcadores de los vinos correspondientes. Estos tienen que ser exactamente del tipo indicado en la carta y con un valor igual o superior al solicitado. A continuación, se descarta la carta, se avanza en el marcador de Puntos de Victoria y en el marcador de Valor Residual tantas posiciones como indique la susodicha carta. El este marcador residual dejará de avanzar una vez alcance la posición de valor 5. Bonificación: se obtiene un punto de victoria adicional. Entrenar Trabajador : pagando 4 Liras se entrena un nuevo trabajador si quedan en la reserva. Este trabajador estará disponible para el próximo año. Bonificación: se obtiene un descuento de 1 Lira para entrenar al trabajador, costando solo 3 Liras. Existen dos acciones especiales que pueden ser ejecutadas tanto en verano como en invierno Ayudar en el tablero principal: se obtiene 1 Lira. Esta acción no tiene límite de trabajadores. Cosechar en el tablero individual: si se ha construido el yugo y el espacio no está ocupado por un trabajador, se puede colocar un trabajador en esta acción para cosechar un campo que no haya sido cosechado este año. Colocaremos un marcador sobre el campo para indicar que este ha sido cosechado este año. Fase V: Fin de Año Se realizan los siguientes procesos: Las uvas y los vinos envejecen, aumentando su valor en uno, salvo que ya se encuentren en el máximo posible no hay ningún valor superior libre accesible. Los jugadores reciben ingresos por el valor residual de los pedidos satisfechos. Cada jugador obtiene el número de Liras indicadas en el rondel de valor residual. Se comprueba si algún jugador excede el límite de la mano de cartas. Si algún jugador poseyese más de 7 cartas, tendrá que descartarse hasta cumplir el límite. Los trabajadores vuelven a los tableros de cada jugador. Se retiran los marcadores de aquellos campos que han sido cosechados. Finalmente, la ficha de jugador inicial para al jugador de la izquierda. Fin de la Partida La partida finaliza en la ronda en la que al menos un jugador alcanza o sobrepasa los 20 Puntos de Victoria. Al término de esta, el ganador será el jugador con más Puntos de Victoria. En caso de empate se utilizan los siguientes elementos para desempatar en orden: Mayor cantidad de Liras. Valor total del vino en las bodegas. Mayor valor de sus uvas en el lagar. Opinión Personal Hoy voy a comenzar hablando del hype. Ya sabemos lo mala que es esa sensación que se apodera de nuestra mente y no nos deja pensar con claridad. Un poderoso y ferviente deseo comienza a gestarse en nuestro interior y no somos capaces de concentrarnos en otra cosa hasta que, una de dos, o tiramos de billetera y satisfacemos nuestro impulso materialista o logramos aplacar nuestras ansias y dejamos que el anhelo se calme, para alivio de nuestra economía. Esto ha sido así desde que el capitalismo domina nuestras vidas. Agentes externos que crean en nosotros una necesidad que satisfacer. Podríamos vivir perfectamente sin ese elemento, pero una vez que nos inoculan el virus, hasta que no obtenemos nuestra droga no podremos ser felices. Al menos hasta el próximo objeto de deseo. El problema surge cuando el elemento a conseguir es, inicialmente, etéreo. Y no me refiero al deseo, sino a la imposibilidad material de obtener aquello que aplacaría nuestras ansias. Y esto es lo que ocurre con las tan de moda campañas de micromecenazgo. Nos ponen los dientes largos con una simple promesa, y allá que vamos como Miuras. Pero, como digo, el simple hecho de apoyar una campaña no calma absolutamente nada. Simplemente nos aporta una pizca de tranquilidad porque hemos establecido un contrato, el cual puede ser roto por la otra parte en cualquier momento. Una promesa de que en un futuro no muy lejano obtendremos eso que nos han prometido como recompensa por apoyar a los creadores. Mientras tanto, el hype puede subir a causa del buen progreso del desarrollo del producto o caer en picado por la mala praxis de los responsables. Pero, indefectiblemente, tendremos que vivir con él durante unos cuantos meses, lo que no suele ser positivo a la hora de evaluar el producto final. Hemos tenido demasiado tiempo para imaginar lo perfecto que va a ser todo. Cumplir las expectativas es una tarea complicada. Algo muy similar a lo que ocurre con las adaptaciones cinematográficas de libros que el espectador ha consumido previamente. Rara vez todo es tan perfecto como en su cabeza. Y con todo este rollo, llegamos a Viticulture , que fue mi primera gran campaña de micromecenazgo. Ya en su día le seguí la pista a la primera edición, pero no anduvimos lo suficientemente rápido para conseguir una copia y obtenerla fuera de la campaña era prohibitivo. El juego era precioso y el tema bastante atractivo. Una pena. A todo esto, debido al gran éxito de la campaña, los chicos de Stonemaier Games decidieron desarrollar una expansión a base de módulos al estilo Fresko. Y, teniendo en cuenta el gran éxito cosechado en la primera edición, por qué no repetir con el proceso? Una nueva campaña de micromecenazgo en la que de manera conjunta a la expansión se iba a realizar una nueva tirada del juego base, teniendo la opción de conseguir una edición coleccionista con ambos títulos en una caja especial. Esta vez no dejamos pasar la ocasión. Y la espera se hizo eterna. Sobre todo porque Jamey publicaba periódicamente actualizaciones de estado en el proyecto, aumentando las ganas de tenerlo ya en casa. Afortunadamente los plazos estuvieron más o menos ajustados a lo prometido y nos llegó el juego con más kilos de mi colección. Entre juego básico y expansión sobrepasan los cinco kilos. Esta disertación puede serviros para intuir por donde van a ir los tiros. Y es que Viticulture ofrece todo lo que promete, pero será suficiente para este humilde tochorreseñador? Empezaré con una advertencia: que nadie espero un juego duro. Viticulture es un familiar con chicha. Alejémonos de las posibles comparaciones con ese monstruo de los Eurogames que es Vinhos. Juegan en ligas completamente distintas. Únicamente comparten el tema. Dicho esto, procedamos. Pero no confundamos el término familiar con facilón o sencillo. La primera comparación directa que viene a nuestras mentes es Stone Age. Ambos dos tienen una mecánica de colocación de trabajadores y manejan conceptos que son asumibles por jugadores no iniciados sin que los expertos estén bostezando continuamente. Continúo con las semejanzas entre títulos. La colocación en ambos casos no es completamente exclusiva. En la mayoría de acciones posibles en ambos juegos existe la posibilidad de que varios jugadores coloquen trabajadores en los mismos lugares, aunque hay un beneficio para los más rápidos. En el caso del juego de la edad de piedra era el poder elegir cuantos trabajadores se colocan o elegir alguna de las acciones exclusivas y en Viticulture la opción de optar a una bonificación que añade valor a la acción. Pero hasta aquí llegan las similitudes más o menos evidentes. Y es que en Viticulture tenemos otra mecánica principal, con mayor peso si cabe que la colocación de trabajadores: la gestión de la mano de cartas. Una vez que juegas un par de partidas te das cuenta de que las diferencias se gestan en el buen hacer de los jugadores a la hora de decidir que cartas tomar, cuales jugar y que otras descartar llegado el caso. Es fundamental entender esto para poder disfrutar del juego de Stegmaier y Stone. Pensar que únicamente podemos alcanzar la victoria gracias a nuestra poderosa capacidad de planificación a la hora de colocar los trabajadores en el tablero. El azar tendrá un papel, no definitivo, pero si importante. De la dama fortuna dependerá que las cartas de Vid que robemos y plantemos sean más o menos acordes con las cartas de Pedido que pasen por nuestra mano. Para paliar esta posible discrepancia aparecen las cartas que más usaremos durante la partida, los Visitantes. Son las variantes que nos permitirán diferenciar nuestra estrategia del resto de jugadores. El encontrar buenos combos será vital para alzarnos con la victoria. Pero, de nuevo, los hados tendrán algo que decir, aunque prácticamente todas estas cartas ofrecen ventajas muy interesante que intentaremos aprovechar. Pero, aunque la suerte pueda intervenir a la hora de ofrecernos combos más o menos suculentos, estos solo podrán ser aprovechados si no descuidamos el eje principal del juego, que es la producción de vino. Aquí nos damos cuenta de que hay que desarrollar una planificación a largo plazo bastante importante. La prueba de ello es que nuestro marcador de puntos tardará en arrancar unos años. Esto es debido a que comenzamos únicamente con tres trabajadores y para poder completar un pedido hay que realizar bastantes acciones: robar cartas de Vid, plantarlas, cosechar y producir el vino. Y todo esto teniendo en cuenta los requisitos de los pedidos. Y eso sin contar que muchas veces tendremos que dejar pasar algún año para que la uva o los vinos alcancen un valor adecuado. Esto viene provocado por uno de los elementos más interesantes del diseño: el reparto de trabajadores. Como hemos visto en la mecánica, cada año se divide en cuatro periodos, de los cuales dos son puramente transicionales, estando en el verano y en el invierno el meollo del asunto. Y para ambas estaciones contaremos con un único grupo de trabajadores, de forma que los que utilicemos en verano no podrán faenar en invierno y viceversa. Habrá que hilar muy fino, pues cada acción vale su peso en oro. Y tiene tanta importancia porque no debemos olvidar que, al final, se trata de una carrera por el prestigio de tener la mejor bodega. Y es aquí donde el juego no termina de cuajar. Esta forma tan abrupta, sin saber si un jugador va a finalizar la partida en un momento poco oportuno hace que el clímax final quede bastante descafeinado. Probablemente sea debido a que en los juegos de colocación de trabajadores estamos acostumbrados a diseños más encorsetados en este sentido, aunque es cierto que uno de los grandes títulos de los últimos tiempos hacía uso de una carrera como excusa para montar una serie de mecánicas a su alrededor. Más bien es una especie de coitus interruptus, ya que cuando el juego se pone más interesante es cuando finaliza, dejándote un sabor agridulce. Lo peor de esto es que, salvo combos espectaculares, no deja espacio a posibles remontadas. En todas las partidas que he jugado, el que se coloca en cabeza con una ventaja relativamente decente 2-3 puntos es difícil que sea desplazado de la primera posición. Esto además se acentúa en partidas a 2 jugadores, en las que las bonificaciones de las acciones no están disponibles. Si los jugadores son del mismo nivel, el proceso normal los mantendrá parejos, y serán los pequeños detalles lo que tendrán mayor importancia. Volviendo a los aciertos del diseño, la implementación del tema es magnífica. A esto ayuda la grandiosa producción, de la que hablaremos más adelante. Todas las acciones cuadran más o menos con el proceso de fabricación del vino, salvando las distancias. A destacar especialmente la mecánica de selección de turno al estilo Fresko o Alquimistas y la separación en estaciones de la ronda. Para los que esta inmersión temática es algo a tener en cuenta, Viticulture es de los mejores juegos que ha pasado por mi mesa. Y después de la zanahoria, toca palo. La escalabilidad es otro elemento donde el juego flojea. Como he dicho, a 2 jugadores desaparece la opción de optar a acciones con bonificación, por lo que las cartas adquieren aun mayor protagonismo. El principal problema es que en partidas uno contra uno es aún más complicado que se den remontadas. Por mucho que te esfuerces, si las cartas no te dan un respiro, difícilmente podrás recortar diferencias. A 3 o 4 es como mejor funciona el juego, tanto por opciones como por duración. Y a 5 o 6 la partida puede alargarse demasiado para las sensaciones que proporciona el juego, además de resultar corto en cuanto a cartas, barajándose el mazo de invitados, tanto de verano como de invierno, un par de veces a lo largo de la partida. La rejugabilidad es relativamente aceptable, ya que, como ya he dicho, una vez dominados los procesos de producción y afinar en la planificación, la clave reside en las cartas, especialmente en las de visitantes. Así pues, las partidas dependerán mucho de la mano que tengamos que gestionar. Pero las sensaciones no serán muy distintas. Pasemos a la edición. Si por algo se caracterizan las exitosas campañas de Stonemaier Games es por su espléndida producción. Y esta segunda reimpresión de Viticulture , incluso, eleva el nivel. El cartón es de una buena calidad, con un grosor y una firmeza bastante aceptables. Los elementos de madera tienen un detalle espectacular, aunque esto puede ser contraproducente en algunos casos, ya que algunos elementos pueden romperse fácilmente al ser demasiado finos. Pero bueno, somos jugadores cuidadosos y no maltratamos nuestros queridos tesoros. Las cartas son de tamaño euro mini, también de un grosor adecuado, con el borde blanco y con un acabado con brillo me refiero a lo contrario de mate. Ya sabéis que yo siempre recomiendo enfundar, aunque este es uno de esos casos en los que no es estrictamente necesario. Pero como digo, en esta segunda edición se han añadido algunos elementos que mejoran el acabado de forma increíble. El elemento que más destaca son unas pequeñas cuentas semiesféricas de cristal que se utilizan como marcadores para las uvas y los vinos. El sistema es genial ya que al colocarla sobre un determinado valor, el marcador hace de lente, de forma que vemos el valor aumentado, además de resultar muy agradable a la vista y al tacto. Además se ha reestructurado toda la caja, añadiendo un fabuloso inserto en el que podremos contener todos los elementos de forma ordenada. Un sobresaliente en este aspecto. Respecto a las ilustraciones, la verdad es que el trabajo del trío formado por Davis, Sobel y Montgomery es bastante interesante, con unos trazos ligeramente difuminados que son muy relajantes, muy en consonancia con el tema del juego. Dan ganas de sentarse en una terraza al atardecer, con tu buena copa de vino, compañía agradable y, por supuesto, una divertida partida al juego. Aunque soy consciente de que es ese estilo de dibujo que a muchos puede resultar indiferente. Y vamos cerrando. Viticulture es de esos juegos que ofrecen lo que prometen pero que no terminan de satisfacerte del todo por pequeños, pero importantes, detalles. Un Eurogame con una buena mezcla de mecánicas, con ciertos elementos originales como la separación en estaciones para la colocación de trabajadores y una excelente inmersión temática. Sin embargo, el juego falla en el cierre, ofreciendo un final abrupto y poco satisfactorio, además de, en determinadas ocasiones, tener una importante dependencia del azar. De hecho, la mecánica de gestión de la mano puede llegar a tener más peso que la de colocación de trabajadores. Eso sí, una producción impecable. De esos juegos que siempre apetece tener en una colección, pero que no es imprescindible. Por todo esto le doy un Me gusta esto:\n"

            "***This BGG forum post was composed as a course requirement for a liberal arts seminar at\n",
            "Central College (Modern Board Game Studies: Immersion & Design, SP24). Constructive feedback\n",
            "and conversation from all BGG users is welcomed and encouraged!***\n",
            "At its core, Viticulture is a worker placement game where players compete to build and manage their own vineyards. Each decision feels meaningful, whether it's choosing which grapes to plant, upgrading your winery, or fulfilling orders for discerning customers. With access to increase the number of workers you have; the game doesn't feel too strained when it comes to the number of decisions that can be made each season.\n",
            "Viticulture does a GREAT job of balancing out the usual kinks of worker placement games through the usage of powers granted by cards and certain powers granted to each player. Like most worker-placement games, there a limited number of spots within each action-territory that workers can go into. Once these spots are taken, in most games, that action in then blocked until workers are removed from the board. However, in viticulture, each player has what's called a Grande Worker which can be placed into any territory regardless of spot availability. This not only makes things easier for people who aren't as adept at worker-placement games while also giving more experienced players more options for strategy. This is one of the many things that Viticulture does right when it comes to making the game more exciting for everyone whether it be by making the game easier or adding more options for strategies.\n",
            "When playing worker-placement games, I've always felt that towards the end of a round, I either put workers in places that I don't really need/want due to low availability of spots or due to having done everything I had wanted to do during that round. I think Viticulture does a great job of giving options to players where every worker placed has an impact on the player's strategy and/or their overall gameplay. It didn't ever feel like I was throwing away workers just because I had them on hand. As the game progresses, you have the option to increase the number of workers you're able to use each round. I think the pacing of this action is perfect in Viticulture. It felt as if every time I increased my worker count by one I had at least one more thing that I wanted to do in the next round making it feel like the game was progressing at the same pace as the players were.\n",
            "My one gripe I had when it came to playing Viticulture was the usefulness/diminishing returns of certain structures such as the windmill. For those who don't know, the windmill gives the player a bonus amount of Lira (currency) after planting grapes in your field. After the first/second rounds it felt as if it wasn't even worth my Lira (currency) let alone my worker to build the windmill as its effects had been cut down due to the nature of the first round in which players have most likely already planted grapes in their fields. Uprooting the grapes from your fields and replanting is an option--yes, however, this set of actions doesn't seem to be efficient unless under certain circumstances. I played through the whole game without building the windmill and there wasn't a single time where I thought to myself \"I wish I had the windmill right now for this\". Obviously, I'm not a game designer, however, one thing I came up with that might increase some of the structures' value would be to create cards (whether those be summer/winter visitors, grapes, etc.) that you can only activate if you have the certain structure or have the card state a BONUS action/reward for playing the card while having the structure built. I think making some of the structures more useful in such a way would not only make the game feel a little more complete but could also drastically change the strategies of the players.\n",
            "Overall, I really liked the game and consider it one of my favorite worker-placement games that I've played. The game is mostly self-motivated, in which the players take actions to benefit themselves, however there are opportunities where you can make obstacles for then other players. Which in my opinion is more fun, as no one really has the option of playing the game just to make your life miserable. Viticulture is a wonderful game that I believe can be played by any group of people.\n",

The other structures have much more utility and some are vital to succeed at the game (e.g. Trellis, Irrigation, Medium Cellar and Large Cellar.) Cottage is nice as it gives you extra visitor cards, but it's not essential. Yoke is useful especially in multiplayer games where there's a lot of competition for the 'Harvest' spots.\n",

Do you have to use it on a worker placement spot that you took during your turn?  So, basically doing that spot twice?  Can you use it on any spot, even if the Automa is covering that spot on that turn?  Can you use it for a bonus action that neither you or the Automa are on?  So, if you place your worker on a draw a winter visitor space, would you use that bonus to play another winter visitor card space?  Or if you are on the play a winter visitor, could you use it for a Place a one order action that is blocked by the Automated?\n",

            "This review is part of a 3-part series where I revisit some of my favorite Stonemaier titles (Scythe, Viticulture, and Wingspan) and share my impression of these signature titles. I’m a bit of a Viticulture veteran and have played it at all player counts with/without expansions, right down to the beautiful “wine crate” full edition storage crate. I’ll walk you through the basics and let you decide for yourself. As a player that is constantly playing new titles, it’s rare for me to revisit the same one multiple times. With over a dozen plays of this game, it’s one of my most played.\n",
            "From the Publisher:\n",
            "In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n",
            "The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There’s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n",
            "Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.\n",
            "Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\n",

            "Favorite:\n",
            "One of the most notable things in this game is its two distinctly different worker placement zones. When this game came out, it was the first time I experienced a worker placement that didn’t just have multiple zones on the board you could unlock or pay for, it had two sides that could only access specific actions based on the season. Using this a core hook, they built income and renewal/proliferation steps into the change of seasons that brought the game to a whole new level.\n",
            "Least Favorite:\n",
            "It can be a huge disadvantage to go later in a turn when there can only be a specific number of worker spaces available per action vs player count. They do two things to offset this: Provide a “grande” worker who can go on any action even if the space(s) are full, and allow a draft for turn order at the start of each turn. Still, I have found myself wishing for a second grande worker so often I feel it should almost be addressed. At 2 players and 6 players I think this is most noticeable.\n",

            "– It could be interesting to be able to plant any vine but it only provides half the grapes until you build the structure required.\n",
            "– I’ve almost always sold a field when I play and never had a need for a third.\n",
            "– Can be subject to a lot of luck where it has a fair reliance on card drawing and/or what an opponent does.\n",
            "– A draw 2 pick one mechanic might give the game a little more agency.\n",
            "Interesting moment:\n",
            "In a recent game, an opponent played the “Planner” summer visitor card. This card allowed them to place a worker in the winter season before other players had a chance to get there. As a result, they claimed the Fill action and secured themselves a guaranteed wine order, while everyone else would have to use their Grande worker if they had it still available, or a Winter visitor card that allowed a player to fill an order.  What’s more, they were set to go last in the new season and got to jump turn order for that move. It was a key play that resulted in a huge point shift. Great use of the card.\n",
            "Overall:\n",
            "The seasonal worker and visitor idea was wonderfully executed and added to the reasons that this game is so well received. I got to admit, it isn’t perfect and I still have my frustrations with it. In fact, I’ve inwardly grumbled on the luck aspect or not having access to an action many times. But that’s all a part of it and you either got to embrace it or pass on the game altogether. I feel if you are the type of player to get bent out of shape that a random occurrence just isn’t fair or that your strategy gets derailed due to a space getting filled before you had a chance to go there, then this isn’t for you. If you can get over a few small bumps in the road and still have a smile on, then you’ll have a blast making and selling some wine!\n",
            "Final Thoughts:\n",
            "Whether it was intentional or a happy accident, this game has proved to be equally appealing to men and women alike that I have played with. It’s been a great intro game for me to play with my non-gaming friends who thoroughly love the theme and wine making process. It’d be a nice date or double date choice, or even a night with your family or parents. I love how games have the ability to bring people together at the table and encourage meaningful conversations and overall feeling of belonging and bonding. I think this title does that better than most and for that reason among others, I play it often.\n",

But the key point is that you are indeed harvesting a field to gain grapes that end up on your crush pad, so if you cannot legally gain any grapes from a harvest, then you can't take the harvest action.

Estas acciones son únicas de esta estación y nos prepararán para el otoño e invierno.\n",

En resúmen, se trata de un juego de colocación de trabajadores muy completo y con una selección de acciones que te van a hacer estrujarte los sesos para conseguir vender el vino. Ese vino es muy complicado de conseguir ya que para tener el vino que desean los compradores vas a tener que realizar tareas durante las estaciones previas y trabajar muy duro no solo el mismo años, sino con un proceso de plantación, mejora, cosecha que puede durar varios años. Sin duda una delicia de juego que te enamorará nada más jugar la primera partida. Y además si es la edición \"Essential\", viene aún más completa que el original, quedando un juego redondo.\n",

            "OK just started playing viticulture. Really like it but hate the fact that the booklet doesn't explain every visitor card like the wingspan book does for birds. So have a winter visitor card question if anyone knows the answer. The exporter says 'choose 1: make up to 2 in the cellar, fill 1 order, discard 1 in crush pad for 2 vp'. So bit im confused about, when it says make 2 in cellar, do you take a 2 from the crush pad and make it two in your cellar OR just make 2 in your cellar and not need to have anything in your crush pad OR move 2 up on any wine already in your cellar? Equally, it says you can fill one order. Does that mean I can fill an order for free or that I can fill an order but need the prerequisite wine in the cellar to do so?\n",

            "The cards are essentially a way of doing other actions on the board sometimes with special abilities but more importantly without needing to send a worker to that space. So for instance the card you are talking about will allow you to essentially use the 'make wine tokens' or 'fill order' spaces without needing to put a worker there - maybe someone else has blocked it, or maybe you wanted to use the card for a better effect. However, you do just do the action as you would on the normal space - so making 2 wines in the cellar is moving them from your crush pad (making sure you don't go too far in your cellar unless you've bought the upgrades), and filling an order is just the same as going to the space on the board and you need to have an order card plus the required wines to fill it. Hopefully that makes sense, but essentially the card is just letting you do that action without going to its corresponding space!\n",

            "I just thought of a plausible situation. What if I have two fields with roughly the same low-level vines. Then I use my yoke action to harvest one field thereby filling my crush pad. Now the scenario I mention in my earlier post is plausible. It is my turn and I know that my wife/opponent needs to use the harvest action and let's assume that they do not possess their yoke building and have already used their grande worker this turn.\n",

            "When I first talked about Viticulture, I gave a flippant Mini review:\n",
            "Viticulture – it passes the initial Kickstarter game test – in that we have played it once and no one complained that it sucked, which has been the case with more than half of the KS games that have landed on the gaming table.  Still needs another play prior to writing a review.  The boys want to play it, so maybe I’ll get a different view of it when playing with them as opposed to the gamers.\n",
            "I wasn’t sure how others would take this – but the one of the designers later commented “I will fully accept, “It didn’t suck” as a review of Viticulture.\n",
            "(But I’m looking forward to a full review as well–thanks Dale!)”\n",
            "So, I’ve played the game twice more, and now I’m ready to say what I think about the game…\n",
            "Quick Game Mechanic Overview:\n",
            "Viticulture is a worker-placement game.  It is played over a number of rounds until someone has scored at least 20 points.  At the end of that round, the player with the most points wins. Each player has his own mat which shows his vineyard.  There are areas for planting vines, for storing grapes, for aging wines, etc.  There are also a number of structures on your vineyard which help you be more efficient in your actions.\n",
            "The main board has two main areas – a summer area and a winter area.  Each section of the board has different action spaces, but more on that later.  There are also 4 different decks of cards used in the game: vine cards, order cards, summer visitor cards, winter visitor cards. Each round equals a year, and each of the four seasons is played in turn… until someone has at least 20 points at the end of a year.\n",
            "SPRING: this is essentially turn order determination.  There is actually a start player marker that rotates around with each year, but it pretty much only decides who gets to play in Spring first.  In this first phase, players take turns placing their rooster token on any of the 7 turn order slots.  The later you end up in turn order, the better sort of bonus you will get that year. For instance, if you choose to go first in order, you get no bonus.  If you choose position #6 (out of 7), you automatically score 1VP – which is 5% of the total VP you need to win the game!  Once all players have chosen a unique spot on the chart, the turn order for the rest of the year follows that chart.\n",
            "SUMMER: In summer, you get to place some/all of your workers to do summer specific actions:\n",
            "Draw a vine card: add a vine card to your hand\n",
            "Plant vines: this is how you get vine cards out of your hand and onto the fields on your player mat\n",
            "Build structures: spend gold and build things which make your actions better (i.e. build structures cheaper, get more money for giving yours, draw more cards when you draw, etc)\n",
            "Give a Tour: essentially, get gold from bank\n",
            "Sell Grapes: Though you normally want to make wine, sometimes you need to sell your grapes to get a bit of cash\n",
            "Play a Summer Visitor Card: Visitor cards have special actions/abilities on them which generally break the standard rules of the game\n",
            "It should be noted that each action has 1 (in 2p), 2 (in 3-4p), or 3 (in 5-6p) action spaces available – each can only be occupied by a single worker. If you are playing with at least 3p, one of the available action spaces gives you a bonus for taking that action – such as drawing an extra card, or gaining one extra gold when you tour, or paying one less gold when you build a structure.\n",
            "FALL: not much goes on here – players get to add a visitor card to their hand.  They choose whether it is a Summer or a Winter Visitor card\n",
            "WINTER: you get to place the rest of your workers in this phase (the ones you did not play in Summer).  The actions are different here, so you have to decide when in the year you need your workers to work.\n",
            "Draw an Order Card – get an order card from the deck\n",
            "Harvest Field – this is how you get grapes from your vineyard\n",
            "Crush Grapes – you convert already harvested grapes and turn them into wine.  The better the quality of grapes you use here, the better the starting quality of the wine you produce.\n",
            "Fulfill a Wine Order – trade in wines of type/quality specified on the card and receive between 2-6 VPs\n",
            "Train a Worker – get an extra worker for use in later rounds of the game\n",
            "YEAR END (Upkeep) – in between winter and spring, you clean up your area.  All grapes and wines age – each moves to the next most valuable space on the chart – as long as you have space for them and capacity to hold that sort of wine.  All players discard down to 7 cards in their hand (between all 4 types) and the start player token moves clockwise.  Unless, of course, someone has at least 20 points.  If so, the player with the most points wins.  In a weird twist, you cannot score more than 25 points, so it is possible that two players could tie at 25, even though both scored more than that, and then go to the tiebreaker to determine the winner.\n",
            "The whole wine production is a multi-step process, and it takes a play or two to really get into the flow of this process.  The steps needed are:\n",
            "Get vine card(s) – done in summer phase\n",
            "Plant vines – summer\n",
            "Harvest field – winter\n",
            "Crush Grapes – winter – this is a complicated sub-step.  Here, you might only use white grapes to make white wine, only red grapes to make red wine, one red and one white to make a blush or 2 red and one white to make a sparkling wine…\n",
            "Age wine – year end\n",
            "Draw an order card – winter\n",
            "Fulfill an order card – winter\n",
            "MY THOUGHTS ON THE GAME:\n",
            "Viticulture is subtitled “the Strategic Game of Winemaking”, and I must admit that the theme is strong in the game.  As you progress through this worker-placement game, you do often get the feeling that you’re toiling away in Tuscany making tasty bottles of wine.  And, like I said in my first flippant review, “it doesn’t suck”.   After 4 plays, I can confirm that it doesn’t suck, but it also didn’t get any better.  It is a solid first design from both the designers and publisher, but there are a few areas that hold it back from being a great game.\n",
            "As far as worker placement games go, Viticulture has a number of things going for it.  I do like the turn-order choosing phase.  Each player gets his turn to choose first for order, but there are some definite worthwhile bonuses that may make you choose later.  I like this initial choice as both your turn order location as well as your bonus can really determine how your year goes.  It’s not an entirely new mechanic – it has been used recently in Fresco and Last Will – but it fits in nicely here.\n",
            "I also like the split of actions – it can be a difficult choice to choose when to use your workers.  Most worker placement games allow you to use all your workers each year.  In Viticulture, you have the added level of complexity of having to split your workers up amongst two completely distinct placement areas.  The actions are all valuable, and it is crucial to make sure that you get the actions when you need them or else you’ll have to wait an entire game year to get an opportunity to do that action again… and this will slow down your entire wine producing engine for a year. The bonuses available for each particular action also add a nice bit of tension to the game because it creates some racing to each action in order to get the bonus.\n",
            "Where the game falls apart for me is with the visitor cards.  They are meant to add a bit of spice to the game as they are somewhat unpredictable and can allow for great swings in fortune.  For me, they are too varied and not overly balanced.  These visitor cards are essentially distributed at random – you get one to start the game, one in each Fall phase, and then you can place a worker on the summer or winter Draw a Worker card space to get them.\n",
            "For example, in the summer cards, you might randomly draw the Architect which allows you to build a structure at a 3 gold discount.  Now, 3 gold is nothing to sneeze at in this game, and the Architect does save you from having to fight for a build structure worker space (well, it just shifts it because instead you have to fight for a play-a-summer-visitor-card space instead).  But… what if you had the Horticulturist, a card which allows you to uproot 1 vine card and discard it for VPs equal to the grape value of that card (as much as 4VP).  Trust me, 4VP is worth many times more than 3 gold in this game.  Heck, it’s 20% – TWENTY PERCENT – A FULL ONE-FIFTH! – of what you need to win the game.  In a single card that you happened to draw randomly.  The winter cards have similar weak and strong cards.\n",
            "Now, I can see the argument that the draw a worker card space is open to everyone, and if you really want to get one, you can choose to go first in turn order to guarantee that you can choose them… but the variability is so high, it just never seems worth it unless you’re doing the equivalent of Grand Tichu in the last round of the game because you have no other viable choice.  It would be madness to put all you eggs in the worker card basket early in the game… yes, you might get a card that essentially allows you to score 3 or 4 VP – which is huge in a race to 20… but you might also draw a card which essentially gives you 2 gold.\n",
            "Some of the worker cards also seem to give you powers that are so strong that they take the place of 3 or 4 regular actions.  These cards also seem overpowered a bit and detract from the engine building nature of the game.   If this were a 30 minute game, that might be fine.  But it leaves a sour taste in your mouth to lose a 2 hour long game just because I was lucky enough to draw an inhumanely good card in the last round on a random whim.\n",
            "Overall, it’s a solid game, and I’m glad to have had a chance to try it.  The production quality is of a high level, the cards have a nice finish to them, there are plenty of custom wood bits and the board/box has decent to above average art.  There are many good ideas in the game itself and all of the concepts work as advertised.   But, I’ve yet to have a game in 4 tries that all the players were satisfied with – mostly due to someone either getting all the good worker cards or one player getting only crappy ones and essentially being disqualified from the game as a result.  With some tweaking of the cards this could be a great game, but the released version falls short of that goal.  Like the wines in the game, this one could have used a few more turns of aging/developing to become a more refined and better product.\n",

Perhaps the Mama and Papa cards updated to add this feature and provide a potential choice of two wines ... and having produceD the most wine in your specialty category could Be a new tie breaker.

In CoB, the art was terrible-I actually don't mind it at all because it's pretty functional. Everything was also thin and cheap, but that appeals to me in that it kept the game from being expensive. Finally, there were a ton of promos for CoB, some of which were difficult to get/were expensive, so having an anniversary edition, while unnecessary, I could understand.\n",
            "With Viticulture, the pieces are nice and wooden and very functional. The art is nice. Not amazing, but by no means needing to be different. The boards are nice and thick, the cards of good quality, and the glass beads are great if a little hard to pick up. There are 3 expansions for Viticulture, all pretty available-excepting of course cheese arboriculture which one could make an attempt at. Nothing Stonemaier could do would get me to buy their game again - I like it a lot, and have everything, and while I don't think it's really disrespectful (it's been out and readily available for 10 ish years), I just don't think it'd make much business sense with all the copies already out in the wild.\n",
            "However, to counter my point, people go bonkers and are more than happy to spend lots of money on a blinged out mega-cool edition of a game, so I could easily be wrong. It does make me sad though that great games are inching toward that line where they will so unaffordable for how many new games get produced every year that people will miss out on their experiences. I feel like our hobby is slowly creating an economic barrier where only those with plenty of disposable cash can afford to try new games. There are of course exceptions, and I'd be content to be proven otherwise, but it's a trend I'm thinking of rather than an absolute.\n",

For these, similarily to your house rule, we make a display of three cards and you can take one of those or the top card of the face down deck. It just seemed strange to run a wine business and not have some control over the orders you would be fulfilling.\n",

I've already ordered Visitors from the Rhine Valley, which we both felt we would prefer as it keeps the focus on winemaking and avoids what amount, to us, to cheap points grabs (I know opinions vary).

And through I love the Grande worker. Oh yeah, I didn't talk about the Grande worker yet. Yeah. The Grande worker is probably my favorite. One of my favorite additions to worker placement game. It's kind of like you're not locked out of the space. You're not getting the full benefit either. I like that. Because it's a game that has sort of\", \"the full benefit either. I like that. Because it's a game that has sort of like a flow to it. You need certain things. So, it's not like other worker placement games like Lords of Waterdeep as an example. In which if you get locked out of a certain location, you can kind of switch its strategy a little bit. And still be in it. This game you kind of need to go certain spaces to kind of keep pace. Yeah. Almost. Yeah. Because it's how different each spot is. So, I like that they added the Grande\", \"Because it's how different each spot is. So, I like that they added the Grande worker to kind of fix that aspect of the game. Because from what my understanding is the Grande worker wasn't part of the original game. Yeah, that's what my understanding was too. The essential addition took in, I believe, the Tuscanie expansion. And it added in everything into just one game. Yeah. So, I really like the addition of the Grande worker. It kind of really makes this game kind of sing for me. Yeah, and\", \"Grande worker. It kind of really makes this game kind of sing for me. Yeah, and like back to like kind of like to reiterate what you said. When it comes to say like a water deep type of game. If you've been locked out of a space, you can't you visit the wait until the next round for you to go back. When it comes to Grande, it's like, okay, I can use my Grande in a summer or the winter. Yeah. If I how badly do I need that space, right? Because if I need this to do what I need to do in the\", \"I need that space, right? Because if I need this to do what I need to do in the winter, but I'm still second or second to last in the winter. Yeah. I don't know if I want to take that risk now, take it later. It's a very planning time. Yeah. You need to plan out. Right. What you how you have to be in between winter and the previous round. Right. Because like once like once you've used your workers in summer, they don't come with you to winter. Yeah. So like if you could actually spend all your\", \"come with you to winter. Yeah. So like if you could actually spend all your workers in summer, if you if you needed to, then have nothing to do for that winter. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like that's that's like kind of like one of the cool things about it too. He's like, oh, I see. So like I I have to really prioritize what, you know, what's important for me to get this wine made. Yeah. I thought it was very interesting when I first played this game that the board is kind of segmented based off\", \"when I first played this game that the board is kind of segmented based off of summer or winter. I thought that was something that was really going to bother me. Right. But I it really works. I think it's because of how thematically sound the game is. In terms of how it utilizes it's it's locations for what you're doing. I think it feels linear, right? Because you start to spring on the floor left. They're like, okay, I know when I'm going to wake up and it has like almost like a like a wave\", \"I know when I'm going to wake up and it has like almost like a like a wave towards the right side, right? Like I know now I need to focus in this section for summer. Then I go further over and then now this is my winter section. And like going back until I say, like player count, like I like the way that they add in extra spaces for the player count. Like it tells you, hey, if you have four players, you can go up to two of these spaces, right? It scales with player count for all of this.\", \"up to two of these spaces, right? It scales with player count for all of this. Agreed. Yeah. And one aspect of this game that I really enjoy and this is going again on a thematically sound aspect is that the build and other resources that you build like the wind, the windmill. Yeah. Like little little aspects of the game that you build out that makes the play not easier for you, but in advance is what you can do in the game. Right. And it just makes it feels like a build and now a venue. You're\", \"game. Right. And it just makes it feels like a build and now a venue. You're adding aspects to it that's going to make the game what you're doing easier for you. Yeah. I didn't like it. So like in most cases, you actually have to take the build structure action, right? Because in order for you to have a bearer, almost wines, like you need to have the the blush wine or like the champagne wine. You need to actually have the medium and the large seller and you can't just go straight to building a\", \"the medium and the large seller and you can't just go straight to building a large seller. You have to build medium first and then you have to build them to large. Yeah, man. Those take a lot of money. Yeah. Like you build it takes a lot of money, but it also feels like you build enough of business. Yeah, exactly. It's like you don't, yeah, you don't go crazy at first. You don't build a huge one. You're like, oh, I don't know what the story is. Then there's like, oh, yeah, I need the medium and\", \"know what the story is. Then there's like, oh, yeah, I need the medium and now I want to actually now can eat into medium wines. Yeah. And then now you can now build out into your large home. What do you think about how turn order works in this game? Because it changes from year to year. I love games that have variable turn order. I don't, sometimes like you can almost like in games where like say you're about to end around and you have a certain amount of money, but you know you're first and\", \"around and you have a certain amount of money, but you know you're first and you're going to see like some, you know, someone is like ending their turn and I'm like, okay, I'm not going to do my action because I know I'm first next turn. This game kind of like flips it a little bit in that, oh, it's, you can you can shift around. So we might skip me to the next person, but then I'll come back to me for the second turn. Yeah. I like that because it also gives me an incentive like say I need\", \"turn. Yeah. I like that because it also gives me an incentive like say I need another visitor. I can go further down the list, get that visitor card if it doesn't, it doesn't really affect what I need to do for that year because I know if I go second and go to player game, I have the ability to go to most if not all the spaces still. Yeah, I'm a big fan of variable turnovers such as yourself. I think it just adds a great tension to the game. Yeah. It signifies something to the whole group and\", \"great tension to the game. Yeah. It signifies something to the whole group and it makes everyone think about what's happening for that round that's coming up. So specifically for a video culture, if a player goes to first, they go to number one, they want to go first. It makes everyone think why did they do that? Because any other order gives you any other number that you go to gives you a resource. Yeah, something. Yes, gives you something that you need. If you go to one, you're not gaining\", \"Yes, gives you something that you need. If you go to one, you're not gaining anything, but the person being still guaranteed that you're going to go first. Right. Why would you do that? Yeah. And then it adds that interest and tension to that round. Yeah. I love that kind of stuff. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I'll be very good turnovers. Yes. So one of the other cool things about the culture is the idea of the crush pad. So once you make wine and you play onto your crush pad from your vine, you can\", \"So once you make wine and you play onto your crush pad from your vine, you can actually turn those into wine in your cellar by combining different colors of crush pad. Yeah. So you have the red and then you have the white. You can actually then combine them to make a blush wine or to make a champagne wine or sparkling wine. But that's really kind of like the cool thing because it's also gets aged as well. Anything that remains on your crush pad gets moved on. Yeah. And then you fill out these\", \"that remains on your crush pad gets moved on. Yeah. And then you fill out these orders off of that once you make your wine. So you'll have like the red, the little order on the top left of the card. Then you get the victory points, which is like one of the main ways you can win in this game is getting these victory points. Yeah. But it also comes with the residual. So there's a little piece on the board that gives you almost a residual amount of money to start with at the start of each year.\", \"you almost a residual amount of money to start with at the start of each year. And sometimes that feels good because sometimes you're really in money deprived. So currently in this game to get money is to be like, okay, I can do stuff now. I can you know, develop my buildings a little better. I can spend it on you know, paying for this you know, visitor or this worker on my board. And it's to be great, you know, kind of like cycle that it would go through. Yeah. No, 100 percent. So in terms of\", \"of like cycle that it would go through. Yeah. No, 100 percent. So in terms of buy, play or skip altogether, what are you reading? Did it culture? Hmm. That's a question. Um, huh, man. I had to think about what my favorite worker placement games are. And I feel like during the pandemic, there wasn't a game that I played more than this one in terms of worker placement. Yeah. I think often that I would have to say this is definitely a buy as an essential, for the essential addition, this is\", \"this is definitely a buy as an essential, for the essential addition, this is definitely a buy. Yeah. It just feels like I'm almost immersed in the vineyard theme. And I, I understand if you don't like that idea, then this might not be your type of game. Yeah. Um, but I just love going through each of these almost years, these rounds. And it just feels like I'm kind of like playing out a vineyard. You know, yeah. It's, it's, to me, it's like almost relaxing when I play this game. I don't feel\", \"it's, to me, it's like almost relaxing when I play this game. I don't feel like I'm really competing too much when I play this game. Yeah. Other than what you're self-conscious. Yeah. Sort of. And like I've heard cases where like, you know, if it's actually possible not to make wine in this game and still win. Oh, and I've seen that and it actually has happened when I played, but it's still a fun game. I think it's, I think that's still a great aspect to find a way to do it without having to\", \"I think that's still a great aspect to find a way to do it without having to build out your seller, build out your wine. If that's a possibility for you, we didn't even talk about the models of poppies yet because those give you starting abilities. Yeah. Um, but there, there's just a lot of variety I feel in this game that I think if you like work for placement, this is definitely one that you should definitely check out at the very least. I agree with you there. This is also a buy for me as\", \"out at the very least. I agree with you there. This is also a buy for me as well. Um, one thing that you said about this game is you mentioned that this is very relaxing for you. Mm hmm. And I think this is kind of, it has a really, really good flow. In terms of summer to winter, just kind of feeling of building up a vineyard. Right. Because you don't really start selling your wine until later in the game is not like something you do in the first couple turns. Yeah. Um, it just, it really does\", \"something you do in the first couple turns. Yeah. Um, it just, it really does have a really, really nice flow. And if you like work for placement games, I think this does a lot of things within that, that genre of board games very well. Really? Especially in terms of matching it to the theme of the game as well. It just all flows and fits together very well. All the spots and all the workers spots that you can go into are really thought out and really fits to what they're trying to do and make\", \"are really thought out and really fits to what they're trying to do and make you feel while you're playing the game. I do know that this is not a game for everyone. We played this with people who we've been this and, yeah, so we might be outliers in terms of all. Yeah, it feels like we are, yeah. But it does really works for me. And it's not in a game that I pull out, we want to pull out all the time, but it's definitely a game that I still were very even in the game. Yeah, I think we've only\", \"a game that I still were very even in the game. Yeah, I think we've only played it once this year. Yeah. For far, but I remember that one play just being like, I remember like the skate just so great. Yeah, I really enjoyed this game a lot. Yeah, it just works. Everything that it's trying to do, it, it does very well. Yeah. I can't even think of any cons for this game.

Entre juego básico y expansión sobrepasan los cinco kilos. Esta disertación puede serviros para intuir por donde van a ir los tiros.

Viticulture es un familiar con chicha. Alejémonos de las posibles comparaciones con ese', 'es un familiar con chicha. Alejémonos de las posibles comparaciones con ese monstruo de los Eurogames que es Vinhos. Juegan en ligas completamente distintas. Únicamente comparten el tema. Dicho esto, procedamos.

Ambos dos tienen una mecánica de colocación de trabajadores y manejan conceptos que son asumibles por jugadores no iniciados sin que los expertos', 'conceptos que son asumibles por jugadores no iniciados sin que los expertos estén bostezando continuamente. Continúo con las semejanzas entre títulos. La colocación en ambos casos no es completamente exclusiva. En la mayoría de acciones posibles en ambos juegos existe la posibilidad de que varios jugadores coloquen trabajadores en los mismos lugares, aunque hay un beneficio para los más rápidos. En el caso del juego de la edad de piedra era el poder elegir cuantos trabajadores se colocan o', 'de la edad de piedra era el poder elegir cuantos trabajadores se colocan o elegir alguna de las acciones exclusivas y en Viticulture la opción de optar a una bonificación que añade valor a la acción. Pero hasta aquí llegan las similitudes más o menos evidentes. Y es que en Viticulture tenemos otra mecánica principal, con mayor peso si cabe que la colocación de trabajadores: la gestión de la mano de cartas. Una vez que juegas un par de partidas te das cuenta de que las diferencias se gestan en', 'que juegas un par de partidas te das cuenta de que las diferencias se gestan en el buen hacer de los jugadores a la hora de decidir que cartas tomar, cuales jugar y que otras descartar llegado el caso. Es fundamental entender esto para poder disfrutar del juego de Stegmaier y Stone. Pensar que únicamente podemos alcanzar la victoria gracias a nuestra poderosa capacidad de planificación a la hora de colocar los trabajadores en el tablero. El azar tendrá un papel, no definitivo, pero si', 'los trabajadores en el tablero. El azar tendrá un papel, no definitivo, pero si importante. De la dama fortuna dependerá que las cartas de Vid que robemos y plantemos sean más o menos acordes con las cartas de Pedido que pasen por nuestra mano. Para paliar esta posible discrepancia aparecen las cartas que más usaremos durante la partida, los Visitantes. Son las variantes que nos permitirán diferenciar nuestra estrategia del resto de jugadores. El encontrar buenos combos será vital para alzarnos', 'del resto de jugadores. El encontrar buenos combos será vital para alzarnos con la victoria. Pero, de nuevo, los hados tendrán algo que decir, aunque prácticamente todas estas cartas ofrecen ventajas muy interesante que intentaremos aprovechar. Pero, aunque la suerte pueda intervenir a la hora de ofrecernos combos más o menos suculentos, estos solo podrán ser aprovechados si no descuidamos el eje principal del juego, que es la producción de vino. Aquí nos damos cuenta de que hay que desarrollar', 'que es la producción de vino. Aquí nos damos cuenta de que hay que desarrollar una planificación a largo plazo bastante importante. La prueba de ello es que nuestro marcador de puntos tardará en arrancar unos años. Esto es debido a que comenzamos únicamente con tres trabajadores y para poder completar un pedido hay que realizar bastantes acciones: robar cartas de Vid, plantarlas, cosechar y producir el vino. Y todo esto teniendo en cuenta los requisitos de los pedidos. Y eso sin contar que', 'esto teniendo en cuenta los requisitos de los pedidos. Y eso sin contar que muchas veces tendremos que dejar pasar algún año para que la uva o los vinos alcancen un valor adecuado. Esto viene provocado por uno de los elementos más interesantes del diseño: el reparto de trabajadores. Como hemos visto en la mecánica, cada año se divide en cuatro periodos, de los cuales dos son puramente transicionales, estando en el verano y en el invierno el meollo del asunto. Y para ambas estaciones contaremos', 'y en el invierno el meollo del asunto. Y para ambas estaciones contaremos con un único grupo de trabajadores, de forma que los que utilicemos en verano no podrán faenar en invierno y viceversa. Habrá que hilar muy fino, pues cada acción vale su peso en oro. Y tiene tanta importancia porque no debemos olvidar que, al final, se trata de una carrera por el prestigio de tener la mejor bodega. Y es aquí donde el juego no termina de cuajar. Esta forma tan abrupta, sin saber si un jugador va a', 'no termina de cuajar. Esta forma tan abrupta, sin saber si un jugador va a finalizar la partida en un momento poco oportuno hace que el clímax final quede bastante descafeinado. Probablemente sea debido a que en los juegos de colocación de trabajadores estamos acostumbrados a diseños más encorsetados en este sentido, aunque es cierto que uno de los grandes títulos de los últimos tiempos hacía uso de una carrera como excusa para montar una serie de mecánicas a su alrededor. Más bien es una', 'como excusa para montar una serie de mecánicas a su alrededor. Más bien es una especie de coitus interruptus, ya que cuando el juego se pone más interesante es cuando finaliza, dejándote un sabor agridulce. Lo peor de esto es que, salvo combos espectaculares, no deja espacio a posibles remontadas. En todas las partidas que he jugado, el que se coloca en cabeza con una ventaja relativamente decente 2-3 puntos es difícil que sea desplazado de la primera posición. Esto además se acentúa en', 'es difícil que sea desplazado de la primera posición. Esto además se acentúa en partidas a 2 jugadores, en las que las bonificaciones de las acciones no están disponibles. Si los jugadores son del mismo nivel, el proceso normal los mantendrá parejos, y serán los pequeños detalles lo que tendrán mayor importancia. Volviendo a los aciertos del diseño, la implementación del tema es magnífica. A esto ayuda la grandiosa producción, de la que hablaremos más adelante. Todas las acciones cuadran más o', 'producción, de la que hablaremos más adelante. Todas las acciones cuadran más o menos con el proceso de fabricación del vino, salvando las distancias. A destacar especialmente la mecánica de selección de turno al estilo Fresko o Alquimistas y la separación en estaciones de la ronda. Para los que esta inmersión temática es algo a tener en cuenta, Viticulture es de los mejores juegos que ha pasado por mi mesa. Y después de la zanahoria, toca palo. La escalabilidad es otro elemento donde el juego', 'de la zanahoria, toca palo. La escalabilidad es otro elemento donde el juego flojea. Como he dicho, a 2 jugadores desaparece la opción de optar a acciones con bonificación, por lo que las cartas adquieren aun mayor protagonismo. El principal problema es que en partidas uno contra uno es aún más complicado que se den remontadas. Por mucho que te esfuerces, si las cartas no te dan un respiro, difícilmente podrás recortar diferencias. A 3 o 4 es como mejor funciona el juego, tanto por opciones', 'diferencias. A 3 o 4 es como mejor funciona el juego, tanto por opciones como por duración. Y a 5 o 6 la partida puede alargarse demasiado para las sensaciones que proporciona el juego, además de resultar corto en cuanto a cartas, barajándose el mazo de invitados, tanto de verano como de invierno, un par de veces a lo largo de la partida. La rejugabilidad es relativamente aceptable, ya que, como ya he dicho, una vez dominados los procesos de producción y afinar en la planificación, la clave', 'vez dominados los procesos de producción y afinar en la planificación, la clave reside en las cartas, especialmente en las de visitantes. Así pues, las partidas dependerán mucho de la mano que tengamos que gestionar. Pero las sensaciones no serán muy distintas. Pasemos a la edición.

El cartón es de una buena calidad, con un', ', incluso, eleva el nivel. El cartón es de una buena calidad, con un grosor y una firmeza bastante aceptables.

Las cartas son de tamaño euro mini, también de un grosor adecuado, con el borde blanco y con un acabado con brillo', 'también de un grosor adecuado, con el borde blanco y con un acabado con brillo me refiero a lo contrario de mate. Ya sabéis que yo siempre recomiendo enfundar, aunque este es uno de esos casos en los que no es estrictamente necesario. Pero como digo, en esta segunda edición se han añadido algunos elementos que mejoran el acabado de forma increíble. El elemento que más destaca son unas pequeñas cuentas semiesféricas de cristal que se utilizan como marcadores para las uvas y los vinos. El sistema', 'cristal que se utilizan como marcadores para las uvas y los vinos. El sistema es genial ya que al colocarla sobre un determinado valor, el marcador hace de lente, de forma que vemos el valor aumentado, además de resultar muy agradable a la vista y al tacto.

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.', 'The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There’s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.', 'Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.', 'Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards).

The boys want to play it, so maybe I’ll get a different view of it when playing with them as opposed to the gamers.', 'I wasn’t sure how others would take this – but the one of the designers later commented “I will fully accept, “It didn’t suck” as a review of Viticulture.\\n(But I’m looking forward to a full review as well–thanks Dale!)”\\nSo, I’ve played the game twice more, and now I’m ready to say what I think about the game…\\nQuick Game Mechanic Overview:', 'Quick Game Mechanic Overview:\\nViticulture is a worker-placement game.  It is played over a number of rounds until someone has scored at least 20 points.  At the end of that round, the player with the most points wins. Each player has his own mat which shows his vineyard.  There are areas for planting vines, for storing grapes, for aging wines, etc.  There are also a number of structures on your vineyard which help you be more efficient in your actions.', 'The main board has two main areas – a summer area and a winter area.  Each section of the board has different action spaces, but more on that later.  There are also 4 different decks of cards used in the game: vine cards, order cards, summer visitor cards, winter visitor cards. Each round equals a year, and each of the four seasons is played in turn… until someone has at least 20 points at the end of a year.', 'SPRING: this is essentially turn order determination.  There is actually a start player marker that rotates around with each year, but it pretty much only decides who gets to play in Spring first.  In this first phase, players take turns placing their rooster token on any of the 7 turn order slots.  The later you end up in turn order, the better sort of bonus you will get that year. For instance, if you choose to go first in order, you get no bonus.  If you choose position #6 (out of 7), you', 'go first in order, you get no bonus.  If you choose position #6 (out of 7), you automatically score 1VP – which is 5% of the total VP you need to win the game!  Once all players have chosen a unique spot on the chart, the turn order for the rest of the year follows that chart.', 'SUMMER: In summer, you get to place some/all of your workers to do summer specific actions:\\nDraw a vine card: add a vine card to your hand\\nPlant vines: this is how you get vine cards out of your hand and onto the fields on your player mat\\nBuild structures: spend gold and build things which make your actions better (i.e. build structures cheaper, get more money for giving yours, draw more cards when you draw, etc)\\nGive a Tour: essentially, get gold from bank', 'Give a Tour: essentially, get gold from bank\\nSell Grapes: Though you normally want to make wine, sometimes you need to sell your grapes to get a bit of cash\\nPlay a Summer Visitor Card: Visitor cards have special actions/abilities on them which generally break the standard rules of the game', 'It should be noted that each action has 1 (in 2p), 2 (in 3-4p), or 3 (in 5-6p) action spaces available – each can only be occupied by a single worker. If you are playing with at least 3p, one of the available action spaces gives you a bonus for taking that action – such as drawing an extra card, or gaining one extra gold when you tour, or paying one less gold when you build a structure.', 'FALL: not much goes on here – players get to add a visitor card to their hand.  They choose whether it is a Summer or a Winter Visitor card\\nWINTER: you get to place the rest of your workers in this phase (the ones you did not play in Summer).  The actions are different here, so you have to decide when in the year you need your workers to work.\\nDraw an Order Card – get an order card from the deck\\nHarvest Field – this is how you get grapes from your vineyard', 'Harvest Field – this is how you get grapes from your vineyard\\nCrush Grapes – you convert already harvested grapes and turn them into wine.  The better the quality of grapes you use here, the better the starting quality of the wine you produce.\\nFulfill a Wine Order – trade in wines of type/quality specified on the card and receive between 2-6 VPs\\nTrain a Worker – get an extra worker for use in later rounds of the game', 'YEAR END (Upkeep) – in between winter and spring, you clean up your area.  All grapes and wines age – each moves to the next most valuable space on the chart – as long as you have space for them and capacity to hold that sort of wine.  All players discard down to 7 cards in their hand (between all 4 types) and the start player token moves clockwise.  Unless, of course, someone has at least 20 points.  If so, the player with the most points wins.  In a weird twist, you cannot score more than 25', 'with the most points wins.  In a weird twist, you cannot score more than 25 points, so it is possible that two players could tie at 25, even though both scored more than that, and then go to the tiebreaker to determine the winner.', 'The whole wine production is a multi-step process, and it takes a play or two to really get into the flow of this process.  The steps needed are:\\nGet vine card(s) – done in summer phase\\nPlant vines – summer\\nHarvest field – winter\\nCrush Grapes – winter – this is a complicated sub-step.  Here, you might only use white grapes to make white wine, only red grapes to make red wine, one red and one white to make a blush or 2 red and one white to make a sparkling wine…\\nAge wine – year end', 'Age wine – year end\\nDraw an order card – winter\\nFulfill an order card – winter\\nMY THOUGHTS ON THE GAME:', 'Viticulture is subtitled “the Strategic Game of Winemaking”, and I must admit that the theme is strong in the game.  As you progress through this worker-placement game, you do often get the feeling that you’re toiling away in Tuscany making tasty bottles of wine.  And, like I said in my first flippant review, “it doesn’t suck”.   After 4 plays, I can confirm that it doesn’t suck, but it also didn’t get any better.  It is a solid first design from both the designers and publisher, but there are', 'It is a solid first design from both the designers and publisher, but there are a few areas that hold it back from being a great game.', 'As far as worker placement games go, Viticulture has a number of things going for it.  I do like the turn-order choosing phase.  Each player gets his turn to choose first for order, but there are some definite worthwhile bonuses that may make you choose later.  I like this initial choice as both your turn order location as well as your bonus can really determine how your year goes.  It’s not an entirely new mechanic – it has been used recently in Fresco and Last Will – but it fits in nicely', '– it has been used recently in Fresco and Last Will – but it fits in nicely here.', 'I also like the split of actions – it can be a difficult choice to choose when to use your workers.  Most worker placement games allow you to use all your workers each year.  In Viticulture, you have the added level of complexity of having to split your workers up amongst two completely distinct placement areas.  The actions are all valuable, and it is crucial to make sure that you get the actions when you need them or else you’ll have to wait an entire game year to get an opportunity to do', 'or else you’ll have to wait an entire game year to get an opportunity to do that action again… and this will slow down your entire wine producing engine for a year. The bonuses available for each particular action also add a nice bit of tension to the game because it creates some racing to each action in order to get the bonus.', 'Where the game falls apart for me is with the visitor cards.  They are meant to add a bit of spice to the game as they are somewhat unpredictable and can allow for great swings in fortune.  For me, they are too varied and not overly balanced.  These visitor cards are essentially distributed at random – you get one to start the game, one in each Fall phase, and then you can place a worker on the summer or winter Draw a Worker card space to get them.', 'For example, in the summer cards, you might randomly draw the Architect which allows you to build a structure at a 3 gold discount.  Now, 3 gold is nothing to sneeze at in this game, and the Architect does save you from having to fight for a build structure worker space (well, it just shifts it because instead you have to fight for a play-a-summer-visitor-card space instead).  But… what if you had the Horticulturist, a card which allows you to uproot 1 vine card and discard it for VPs equal to', 'a card which allows you to uproot 1 vine card and discard it for VPs equal to the grape value of that card (as much as 4VP).  Trust me, 4VP is worth many times more than 3 gold in this game.  Heck, it’s 20% – TWENTY PERCENT – A FULL ONE-FIFTH! – of what you need to win the game.  In a single card that you happened to draw randomly.  The winter cards have similar weak and strong cards.', 'Now, I can see the argument that the draw a worker card space is open to everyone, and if you really want to get one, you can choose to go first in turn order to guarantee that you can choose them… but the variability is so high, it just never seems worth it unless you’re doing the equivalent of Grand Tichu in the last round of the game because you have no other viable choice.  It would be madness to put all you eggs in the worker card basket early in the game… yes, you might get a card that', 'in the worker card basket early in the game… yes, you might get a card that essentially allows you to score 3 or 4 VP – which is huge in a race to 20… but you might also draw a card which essentially gives you 2 gold.', 'Some of the worker cards also seem to give you powers that are so strong that they take the place of 3 or 4 regular actions.  These cards also seem overpowered a bit and detract from the engine building nature of the game.   If this were a 30 minute game, that might be fine.  But it leaves a sour taste in your mouth to lose a 2 hour long game just because I was lucky enough to draw an inhumanely good card in the last round on a random whim.', 'Overall, it’s a solid game, and I’m glad to have had a chance to try it.  The production quality is of a high level, the cards have a nice finish to them, there are plenty of custom wood bits and the board/box has decent to above average art.  There are many good ideas in the game itself and all of the concepts work as advertised.   But, I’ve yet to have a game in 4 tries that all the players were satisfied with – mostly due to someone either getting all the good worker cards or one player', '– mostly due to someone either getting all the good worker cards or one player getting only crappy ones and essentially being disqualified from the game as a result.  With some tweaking of the cards this could be a great game, but the released version falls short of that goal.  Like the wines in the game, this one could have used a few more turns of aging/developing to become a more refined and better product.', '--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTítulo del hilo: Guidance requested: Distance play over Zoom, etc...\\nContenido:\\nSo, with the family spread over the countryside and everyone possessing their own game, I wondered: How can we play remotely, at a distance?\\nSetting up Zoom/Skype or any video conferencing would work: Getting everyone to visually sync with the board is, perhaps, the easy part.', \"It's the card draws that I wondered about.

With some tweaking of the cards this could be a great game, but the released version falls short of that goal.  Like the wines in the game, this one could have used a few more turns of aging/developing to become a more refined and better product.\n",
            "2. Some of the worker cards also seem to give you powers that are so strong that they take the place of 3 or 4 regular actions.  These cards also seem overpowered a bit and detract from the engine building nature of the game.   If this were a 30 minute game, that might be fine.  But it leaves a sour taste in your mouth to lose a 2 hour long game just because I was lucky enough to draw an inhumanely good card in the last round on a random whim.\n",

Trust me, 4VP is worth many times more than 3 gold in this game.  Heck, it’s 20% – TWENTY PERCENT – A FULL ONE-FIFTH! – of what you need to win the game.  In a single card that you happened to draw randomly.  The winter cards have similar weak and strong cards.\n",
            "4. in the worker card basket early in the game… yes, you might get a card that essentially allows you to score 3 or 4 VP – which is huge in a race to 20… but you might also draw a card which essentially gives you 2 gold.\n",
            "5. the windmill right now for this\". Obviously, I'm not a game designer, however, one thing I came up with that might increase some of the structures' value would be to create cards (whether those be summer/winter visitors, grapes, etc.) that you can only activate if you have the certain structure or have the card state a BONUS action/reward for playing the card while having the structure built. I think making some of the structures more useful in such a way would not only make the game feel a\n"
